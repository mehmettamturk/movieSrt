1
00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.041
So tell me. How was Hawaii?

2
00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:55.527
- It was unbelievable.
- Oh, yeah?

3
00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:58.123
- Well, what happened?
- I met this guy.

4
00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.757
It was the best week of my life.

5
00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:03.682
It was just a little
vacation romance.

6
00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:05.646
But he was so sweet.

7
00:01:05.809 --> 00:01:08.039
He took me to all these
cool local places.

8
00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:10.404
We went scuba diving...

9
00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:12.844
- Snorkelling.
- Mountain climbing.

10
00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:15.446
We went cliff diving.

11
00:01:17.089 --> 00:01:19.842
Well, we got a little drunk.

12
00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.806
- He gave me...
- A back rub.

13
00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:23.197
We slow danced...

14
00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.688
- in the rain.

15
00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:26.885
But it wasn't just about the sex.

16
00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:30.201
He pounded me like a mallard duck.

17
00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.240
It ended kind of weird, though.

18
00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.559
When I asked for his number,
he said he's...

19
00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:36.957
- Married.
- Gay.

20
00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:39.689
- Entering the priesthood.
- He doesn't believe in phones.

21
00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:43.080
He just kind of ran away.

22
00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:45.638
You know, it was just
a little fling, but...

23
00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:47.242
I won't forget my week...

24
00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:48.762
- with Henry Roth.

25
00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:51.523
- Henry Roth.
- Harry.

26
00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.123
Harry Paratesticles.

27
00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:56.280
- Henry Roth.
- Henry Roth.

28
00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:58.565
- Henry Roth.
- Henry Roth.

29
00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.801
Henry Roth, why didn't you tell me
you were a secret agent?

30
00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:06.440
I prefer intelligence operative,
and I couldn't tell you until I knew you.

31
00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:08.520
Well, can I call you when I land?

32
00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:12.079
You can call me, but I'll be in Peru.
I said that a little loud.

33
00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:16.037
Come on, that's a 187, code blue.
We got the wolf sleeping at night.

34
00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.361
He's slipping his arm in the drawer
and out comes the cookie jar. All clear.

35
00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:22.443
Got it?

36
00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:25.558
Well, maybe when you
get back from Peru.

37
00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:29.001
- I don't think that's an option, Lisa.
- Linda.

38
00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:32.366
I know. I changed your name
for your protection.

39
00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:36.448
We have to go our separate ways now.

40
00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.998
Well, goodbye.

41
00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:40.921
Got it! Moving out!

42
00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:48.443
- What the hell is your problem?
- Just keep going, I'll give you $20.

43
00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.648
- You got it. How's your balls?
- Killing me. Hit it.

44
00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:09.003
Easy, Honah Lee.

45
00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.237
Hey, I'm a person, not a seal.

46
00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:17.688
Well, I am a vet, not a doctor. So just
hold still, or I won't give you a treat.

47
00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.646
I know, it's okay.
You see that, kids?

48
00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:22.721
You see what happens
when you play with sharks?

49
00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:26.245
Now, why you gotta spread those lies?
Sharks are like dogs.

50
00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:28.923
They only bite when you
touch their private parts.

51
00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.120
That's a good title
for my documentary.

52
00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:36.202
Sharks: They Only Bite When
You Touch Their Private Parts.

53
00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:39.805
Or you could call it,
Sharks: They Tried to Eat My Kidney

54
00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:43.200
All right, enough already.
You too, Willie.

55
00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:47.322
All of you.

56
00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:49.162
He just cast a spell on us.

57
00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:53.202
All right. Put this on four times
a day for two weeks.

58
00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:56.167
- You can handle that.
- What's wrong with that turtle?

59
00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.002
Lung problems because
he smoked too much turtle weed...

60
00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:01.160
...which is bad for you. Right, Ula?

61
00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.638
What? I don't smoke weed.

62
00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:08.481
Hey, Honah Lee? How's that hot
wahine nympho from Ohio?

63
00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:11.243
Great. I dropped her off
at the airport this morning.

64
00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:12.842
Come on, I need some details.

65
00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:16.046
You get some booby, some assy,
a pull on your poi-poi? Come on.

66
00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.801
Daddy, what's a nympho?

67
00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.284
Oh. The nympho
is the state bird of Ohio.

68
00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:26.121
You're the state idiot of Hawaii.

69
00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:29.440
Here you go. Bite the fish,
chew the fish, love the fish. Enjoy.

70
00:04:29.609 --> 00:04:32.282
- You crack me up, kamaaina
- Oh, yeah?

71
00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:33.802
- One of these days...
- Yeah?

72
00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:36.642
...you'll show one of those
tourists such a good time...

73
00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:38.527
...she'll wanna stay on the island.

74
00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:40.520
Why do you say
mean things like that...

75
00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:43.078
...and why is your foot
on my pillow?

76
00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:47.246
I don't want your ass on it, either.
Get up! Get up!

77
00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:48.967
It could happen.

78
00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:51.882
Then you won't be able to go
on your boat trip to Alaska.

79
00:04:52.489 --> 00:04:58.519
You'll be stuck here, waking up next to
the same old, ugly broad, just like Ula.

80
00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:05.805
- Just kidding, guys.
- About the old part or the ugly part?

81
00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:10.597
Henry, come quickly!
It's Jocko!

82
00:05:17.049 --> 00:05:19.722
Jocko! What's going on
with you, buddy?

83
00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:22.608
Don't be scared.
Everything's gonna be fine.

84
00:05:22.769 --> 00:05:25.044
Just stay calm. All right.

85
00:05:25.209 --> 00:05:29.168
Willie, I don't need you to see this.
Get out of here, now!

86
00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:31.718
Okay, check the temperature
of the pool. Go! Hurry!

87
00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:36.477
What are you doing?
I meant check the thermometer!

88
00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:38.605
Give me a hand. Let's go!

89
00:05:38.769 --> 00:05:40.964
Get me two fish
from the barrel. Now.

90
00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:42.403
- Okay.
- Just hang in there.

91
00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:44.400
- Here.
- It's gonna be all right.

92
00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:47.527
That's a little warm.
Go to the bottom of the barrel, please.

93
00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:56.359
Okay, there. That's good. Thank you.

94
00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:58.201
Come on, buddy, take it. Take it.

95
00:05:58.369 --> 00:06:00.280
- He's not responding!
- I know, Alexa!

96
00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:03.361
Sorry, I smacked you. You needed
the fish-slap to calm down.

97
00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:06.362
- Do you understand? Are you calm?
- Yes. Fish-slap calm me.

98
00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:08.838
I'm gonna try to get him
breathing manually...

99
00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:12.046
...so I need your face next
to his mouth to see if it's working.

100
00:06:12.209 --> 00:06:13.608
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

101
00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:16.044
- One, two, three!
- Nothing, nothing!

102
00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:20.441
All right! Try it again. If it doesn't
work we'll perform a tracheotomy.

103
00:06:20.609 --> 00:06:23.681
We don't wanna do that, so let's
pray this works. One more time.

104
00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:25.805
One, two...

105
00:06:34.929 --> 00:06:36.920
That's a lot of vomit.

106
00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:40.286
This is why I got into
this business.

107
00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:42.440
To save sea animals.

108
00:06:42.609 --> 00:06:44.486
You should go
wash yourself off, okay?

109
00:06:45.329 --> 00:06:48.207
Maybe try some turpentine.
That might take the stink away.

110
00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:52.046
Yeah, high-five is right, buddy.

111
00:06:52.209 --> 00:06:55.884
I knew you were gonna burp,
but the vomit thing was awesome!

112
00:06:56.049 --> 00:06:59.086
That's what she gets for eating
my roast beef sandwich.

113
00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:00.957
Willie, did you see that?

114
00:07:20.769 --> 00:07:23.886
Captain's log:
November 5th, 6:45 am

115
00:07:24.049 --> 00:07:27.200
I've tak en the Sea Serpent for
a trip around the island of Oahu

116
00:07:27.369 --> 00:07:30.122
It is by far the longest v oyage
she has yet undertak en

117
00:07:30.289 --> 00:07:32.849
and its completion will signal
that she's ready

118
00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:35.045
for our great journey
to Bristol Bay

119
00:07:35.209 --> 00:07:38.565
whose unspoiled walrus habitat
will yield an abundance of...

120
00:07:46.049 --> 00:07:47.960
Damn it!

121
00:07:48.329 --> 00:07:49.887
Are you kidding me?

122
00:08:08.889 --> 00:08:11.084
Aloha, honey.
What can I get for you?

123
00:08:11.249 --> 00:08:13.638
I guess I'll take a cup of coffee.

124
00:08:13.929 --> 00:08:16.363
- You guess?
- Yeah, I already ate breakfast.

125
00:08:16.529 --> 00:08:20.044
I need to kill some time before the
Coast Guard gets here to tow my boat.

126
00:08:20.209 --> 00:08:21.437
What did you eat?

127
00:08:21.609 --> 00:08:25.124
I had a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup
and some Gatorade.

128
00:08:25.289 --> 00:08:28.201
They're not breakfast.
I get you Spam and eggs.

129
00:08:28.369 --> 00:08:30.599
Nick, I need Spam and eggs.

130
00:08:31.249 --> 00:08:32.807
Hey.

131
00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:36.320
- You like the peanut butter cups?
- Yes.

132
00:08:36.489 --> 00:08:38.764
Want me to put peanut butter cups
in your eggs?

133
00:08:39.849 --> 00:08:41.123
No, that's okay.

134
00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:43.807
Peanut butter cups.

135
00:09:00.089 --> 00:09:04.207
- Hey, Sue, nice haircut.
- Mahalo, Lucy.

136
00:09:34.889 --> 00:09:36.527
Are you staring at me or her?

137
00:09:36.689 --> 00:09:38.600
Because you're starting
to freak me out.

138
00:09:39.329 --> 00:09:42.605
Settle down and eat your pancakes.

139
00:09:46.449 --> 00:09:49.122
I think she's a local girl.
I wanted to go up to her...

140
00:09:49.289 --> 00:09:52.406
...but I was kind of off my game.
But, man, was she cute, though.

141
00:09:52.569 --> 00:09:55.003
I thought you liked your bitches
from out of state.

142
00:09:55.409 --> 00:09:59.038
Yeah, that's usually my policy.
Make sure I don't get tied down.

143
00:09:59.209 --> 00:10:01.484
Freeze that image right there.

144
00:10:01.769 --> 00:10:05.398
There's the little fella.
Congratulations, Mommy.

145
00:10:05.729 --> 00:10:09.802
Sounds to me like someone
is afraid of commitment.

146
00:10:09.969 --> 00:10:11.448
Let me guess.

147
00:10:11.609 --> 00:10:13.964
Your high school sweetheart
got drunk at party...

148
00:10:14.129 --> 00:10:17.166
...then cheated on you
with whole wrestling team.

149
00:10:17.329 --> 00:10:20.366
Close. Actually, it was my
college girlfriend Tracy.

150
00:10:20.529 --> 00:10:23.441
And it wasn't a wrestling team.
It was her academic advisor.

151
00:10:23.609 --> 00:10:27.488
- Oh, she liked the older man.
- Older women. About 50 years older.

152
00:10:27.649 --> 00:10:29.719
I hope you shot the stupid tramp.

153
00:10:29.889 --> 00:10:32.164
What's with the "tramp"
and the "bitches" talk?

154
00:10:32.329 --> 00:10:35.765
- Are you drunk or something?
- I apologize for nasty talk.

155
00:10:35.929 --> 00:10:39.160
I am grouchy due to lack
of recent physical intimacy.

156
00:10:39.849 --> 00:10:43.080
Shut up, because here comes
one-time-only opportunity.

157
00:10:43.249 --> 00:10:46.924
What I will do now is go into
your office and become naked.

158
00:10:49.009 --> 00:10:50.601
Next move is up to you.

159
00:10:51.569 --> 00:10:53.878
I may not be as limber
as I once was...

160
00:10:54.049 --> 00:10:59.328
...but I make up for it with enthusiasm
and willingness to experiment.

161
00:11:00.369 --> 00:11:03.167
I don't know if you realize,
I'm not into guys.

162
00:11:21.969 --> 00:11:24.005
Hey, Mr. Peanut Butter Cups.

163
00:11:24.169 --> 00:11:26.683
Hey, Mr. Could-Kill-Me-in-One-Punch.
How you doing?

164
00:11:26.849 --> 00:11:29.409
- You're back.
- Couldn't get enough of that Spam.

165
00:11:29.569 --> 00:11:31.560
Fry some up and throw
some eggs on it.

166
00:11:31.729 --> 00:11:33.242
- You got it.
- All right, mahalo.

167
00:11:33.409 --> 00:11:36.082
- Hi, Lucy.
- Hi, Nick.

168
00:11:49.129 --> 00:11:51.962
You know, why don't you try this?

169
00:11:54.689 --> 00:11:57.157
It's kind of a hinge.

170
00:11:59.489 --> 00:12:03.038
- Now, why didn't I think of that?
- Well, you're too close to the project.

171
00:12:03.209 --> 00:12:04.483
Don't be hard on yourself.

172
00:12:04.929 --> 00:12:07.568
Right. Sometimes you need
an outsider's perspective.

173
00:12:07.729 --> 00:12:09.401
Fresh eye never hurts.

174
00:12:11.489 --> 00:12:12.683
I'm Lucy.

175
00:12:12.849 --> 00:12:14.248
Yes. I'm Henry Roth.

176
00:12:14.409 --> 00:12:16.161
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

177
00:12:16.329 --> 00:12:19.241
It's pretty. Keep up the good work.

178
00:12:20.369 --> 00:12:24.521
Wait. I see you're sitting there alone.
Do you wanna come and sit down?

179
00:12:25.089 --> 00:12:29.162
- Sure, that'd be great, if that's all right.
- Okay.

180
00:12:32.049 --> 00:12:35.724
- So are you an architect?
- I am not. I'm in fish.

181
00:12:35.889 --> 00:12:38.039
Oh, that's where the smell
is coming from.

182
00:12:38.209 --> 00:12:40.769
Yeah, yeah, I was feeding
a walrus this morning...

183
00:12:40.929 --> 00:12:44.604
...and I thought I got most of it
off of me, but guess I didn't.

184
00:12:45.009 --> 00:12:47.318
- I love that smell.
- No, you don't.

185
00:12:47.489 --> 00:12:50.686
- Fish don't even like that smell.
- No, I do. My dad's a fisherman.

186
00:12:51.089 --> 00:12:54.843
He and my brother Doug, they go
out to sea for months at a time.

187
00:12:55.009 --> 00:12:58.399
And I miss them so much while they're
gone that when they come back...

188
00:12:58.569 --> 00:13:02.278
...I just hold on to them
for five minutes each.

189
00:13:05.009 --> 00:13:10.037
And they smell just like your hands.
It's the best smell in the world.

190
00:13:10.729 --> 00:13:12.447
Well, my fingers are available...

191
00:13:12.609 --> 00:13:15.248
...for your sniffing pleasure
anytime you need them.

192
00:13:16.089 --> 00:13:17.966
- Wanna?
- Okay.

193
00:13:26.249 --> 00:13:29.958
Sea lions are known
for their athleticism...

194
00:13:30.129 --> 00:13:32.484
...and dolphins are known
for their intelligence.

195
00:13:33.009 --> 00:13:36.968
- Walruses are known for their...
- Tusks?

196
00:13:37.129 --> 00:13:42.806
Their tusks. Also their male parts
can get pretty gigantic.

197
00:13:43.569 --> 00:13:47.084
Yeah, yeah, it's the second biggest
out of all the mammals.

198
00:13:47.849 --> 00:13:51.159
- What's the first?
- I think Tattoo-Face.

199
00:13:55.409 --> 00:13:57.001
I like your laugh.

200
00:13:57.609 --> 00:13:59.088
I like you making me laugh.

201
00:13:59.249 --> 00:14:01.968
I hate to break this up,
but we're setting up for lunch.

202
00:14:02.289 --> 00:14:04.803
Oh, okay. Sorry, Sue.

203
00:14:05.649 --> 00:14:08.846
And the real cool thing about walruses
is they're very mysterious.

204
00:14:09.009 --> 00:14:11.159
- Mysterious?
- Yeah, yeah.

205
00:14:11.329 --> 00:14:13.968
We don't really know what
they're like in the wild.

206
00:14:14.129 --> 00:14:17.246
Don't they just sleep on icebergs
and yawn all the time?

207
00:14:17.409 --> 00:14:20.162
All we really see is what they do
outside of the water...

208
00:14:20.329 --> 00:14:22.763
...but who knows what
they do under the ice...

209
00:14:22.929 --> 00:14:25.124
...where they spend
two-thirds of their lives.

210
00:14:25.289 --> 00:14:29.805
Well, maybe they're intimidating the
other creatures with their big winkies.

211
00:14:29.969 --> 00:14:32.039
That is one theory.

212
00:14:33.329 --> 00:14:35.559
- I have to go.
- Where you going?

213
00:14:35.729 --> 00:14:39.278
It's my dad's birthday, and we go
every year and we pick a pineapple.

214
00:14:39.449 --> 00:14:43.078
- It's a tradition.
- That sounds nice. Okay, well...

215
00:14:43.249 --> 00:14:44.682
...I had a great time.

216
00:14:44.849 --> 00:14:46.840
- Me too.
- Okay.

217
00:14:47.409 --> 00:14:51.038
Would you like to have breakfast
again tomorrow morning, same time?

218
00:14:51.209 --> 00:14:53.484
- Because I teach an art class at 10.
- Really?

219
00:14:53.649 --> 00:14:55.207
- Yeah.
- I wish I could make it...

220
00:14:55.369 --> 00:14:57.325
...but, yes, I will be there.

221
00:14:59.009 --> 00:15:00.601
- Take care.
- Okay.

222
00:15:00.769 --> 00:15:03.806
- One for the road. It is fishy.
- Got you good.

223
00:15:03.969 --> 00:15:05.322
- Aloha.
- Aloha!

224
00:15:05.489 --> 00:15:07.320
See you tomorrow.

225
00:15:07.489 --> 00:15:10.049
Oh, my God.

226
00:15:10.449 --> 00:15:12.963
Oh, my goodness.

227
00:15:22.289 --> 00:15:24.325
Shit.

228
00:15:25.609 --> 00:15:27.645
I had a bee on me.

229
00:15:27.809 --> 00:15:30.039
- All right.
- He was a big one.

230
00:15:33.249 --> 00:15:36.685
Which means
"look at those two shitheads."

231
00:15:43.889 --> 00:15:46.562
That was the stupidest-looking
swing I've ever seen.

232
00:15:46.729 --> 00:15:48.959
I'm gonna take a Molokai
on that one.

233
00:15:49.129 --> 00:15:51.484
No throwing. Come on.

234
00:15:51.649 --> 00:15:54.209
Stop laughing, you hyenas.
Let's see what you get.

235
00:15:54.369 --> 00:15:56.599
Okay, you heard me. Go! Go!

236
00:15:56.769 --> 00:15:58.282
Show papa what you got.

237
00:16:08.849 --> 00:16:12.728
- You suck, you're good at everything.
- Father of the Year strikes again.

238
00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:17.804
By the way, cuz, I met this sexy, blond
tax attorney at Starbucks today.

239
00:16:17.969 --> 00:16:22.087
I told her you the kahuna
she wanna have fun on this island.

240
00:16:22.249 --> 00:16:23.921
You want her number?

241
00:16:24.089 --> 00:16:25.761
You pimping tourists for me again?

242
00:16:25.929 --> 00:16:28.489
Yes! I live vicariously
through you, remember?

243
00:16:28.649 --> 00:16:29.843
My life sucks.

244
00:16:30.009 --> 00:16:33.126
Now, come on. Give her the Waikikiki
sneaky between the cheeky.

245
00:16:34.129 --> 00:16:38.361
Ula needs it. I imagine I did it and then
I can get through another weekend.

246
00:16:38.529 --> 00:16:40.679
I'm staying in. Sorry.
Thank you, though.

247
00:16:40.849 --> 00:16:42.521
- What?
- Hey, Dad!

248
00:16:42.689 --> 00:16:44.600
Not now, Keanu Mokokokakau.

249
00:16:44.769 --> 00:16:46.282
But your stitches are bleeding.

250
00:16:48.769 --> 00:16:50.441
It must've been my huge back-swing.

251
00:16:50.609 --> 00:16:53.646
You think you can stitch me up
after I get back from surfing?

252
00:16:53.809 --> 00:16:57.165
- Yeah, looking forward to it.
- I wouldn't surf with a wound like that.

253
00:16:57.329 --> 00:16:58.648
You might attract a shark.

254
00:16:58.809 --> 00:17:01.403
What's wrong with that?
Sharks are naturally peaceful.

255
00:17:01.569 --> 00:17:04.447
Is that right?
How'd you get that nasty cut, anyway?

256
00:17:04.609 --> 00:17:06.008
A shark bit me.

257
00:17:06.169 --> 00:17:07.727
Nice.

258
00:17:07.889 --> 00:17:09.800
Go smoke another one, bro.

259
00:17:09.969 --> 00:17:12.085
That shark theory's
starting to catch on.

260
00:17:12.249 --> 00:17:13.967
Now, will everybody keep it down...

261
00:17:14.129 --> 00:17:17.007
...while I whack the crap
out of this thing?

262
00:17:21.969 --> 00:17:23.960
Sit! Stay! Shit! No!

263
00:17:29.169 --> 00:17:31.603
Where the hell is it?

264
00:17:32.529 --> 00:17:33.928
Looking for something?

265
00:17:39.729 --> 00:17:43.085
Oh, my God!
What are you doing here?

266
00:17:43.249 --> 00:17:46.286
The same thing you are.
Looking for my ball.

267
00:17:47.009 --> 00:17:50.718
This is weird. I've been thinking
about you all morning, all day.

268
00:17:50.929 --> 00:17:53.045
Can't wait to have breakfast
with you again.

269
00:17:53.209 --> 00:17:56.042
I know. And I just wanna eat you up.

270
00:17:56.209 --> 00:17:59.519
- Really?
- Yeah. Tomorrow and the next day...

271
00:17:59.689 --> 00:18:02.442
...and the next day and the next day.
- All right. Okay.

272
00:18:03.329 --> 00:18:04.842
Oh, my.

273
00:18:05.009 --> 00:18:08.126
Oh, Lucy, that feels so good.

274
00:18:08.289 --> 00:18:12.521
No, my nipples are too sensitive.
Stop that.

275
00:18:17.009 --> 00:18:19.443
- What happened?
- Your ball hooked into that cart...

276
00:18:19.609 --> 00:18:22.840
...bounced back and hit you in
the head. It was freaking hilarious.

277
00:18:23.449 --> 00:18:24.882
- What?
- Who's Lucy?

278
00:18:25.049 --> 00:18:27.722
And what's up with your nipples?

279
00:18:29.329 --> 00:18:33.038
I can't be falling for a local.
I ain't ever going back to that diner.

280
00:18:33.209 --> 00:18:35.882
- This where you got hit?
- Yes!

281
00:18:41.609 --> 00:18:44.919
You're so lucky you're a professional
cliff diver in Hawaii.

282
00:18:45.089 --> 00:18:47.478
- Yeah, well, it's a living.
- I'm a tax attorney.

283
00:18:47.649 --> 00:18:50.243
- We never get to have any fun.
- Is that right?

284
00:18:50.409 --> 00:18:55.529
I'd like to do something
extra fun tonight.

285
00:19:03.769 --> 00:19:06.522
Taking it deep, aren't you?

286
00:19:11.409 --> 00:19:13.400
How about another
fishbowl for the lady?

287
00:19:13.569 --> 00:19:16.367
- Why don't I just tap a keg for her?
- Okay.

288
00:19:17.169 --> 00:19:19.558
I think I'm getting kind of drunk.

289
00:19:19.729 --> 00:19:22.323
- Are you getting drunk?
- Getting there.

290
00:19:22.489 --> 00:19:25.640
So, what are you thinking?

291
00:19:30.009 --> 00:19:31.567
What am I thinking?

292
00:19:34.369 --> 00:19:37.566
Actually, I'm not drunk at all,
Noreen, and neither are you...

293
00:19:37.729 --> 00:19:40.926
...because there's no alcohol
in these drinks.

294
00:19:41.249 --> 00:19:43.638
Sadly, I've used this technique
many times.

295
00:19:43.809 --> 00:19:45.959
It helps lovely tourists,
such as yourself...

296
00:19:46.129 --> 00:19:49.166
...loosen up without impairing
your ability to stay awake...

297
00:19:49.329 --> 00:19:52.207
...and have guilt-free,
vigorous sex with me.

298
00:19:53.369 --> 00:19:54.882
- Wow.
- I'm sorry.

299
00:19:55.049 --> 00:19:58.598
I'm not a cliff diver, either.
I'm afraid of heights.

300
00:19:58.769 --> 00:20:01.647
Well, since it's my last night in town...

301
00:20:01.809 --> 00:20:06.929
...can I pretend you didn't just say that
and still have sex with you anyway?

302
00:20:07.769 --> 00:20:10.283
I can't do it. I'm sorry.

303
00:20:10.449 --> 00:20:14.078
Well, can you at least point me in
the direction of someone who can?

304
00:20:15.089 --> 00:20:17.478
That guy over there
could help you out.

305
00:20:20.209 --> 00:20:22.677
- Isn't that a woman?
- Jeez, I'm not really sure.

306
00:20:25.169 --> 00:20:29.208
But you're too drunk to notice,
remember? Take care.

307
00:20:37.809 --> 00:20:40.198
- Hey, you. Aloha.
- Aloha.

308
00:20:40.369 --> 00:20:44.408
Not aloha, "hello," aloha, "goodbye."
We're closed today. Go away.

309
00:20:44.569 --> 00:20:46.719
- What are you talking about?
- Order up!

310
00:20:47.089 --> 00:20:49.557
- Don't move. I have to talk to you.
- Okay.

311
00:20:49.729 --> 00:20:52.766
- Hey! Tattoo-Face!
- Hey, Peanut Butter Cups!

312
00:21:03.729 --> 00:21:05.003
Hi.

313
00:21:05.689 --> 00:21:06.883
Hi.

314
00:21:07.049 --> 00:21:10.200
My fingers are extra fishy today,
if you care to take a whiff.

315
00:21:11.809 --> 00:21:13.003
What was that?

316
00:21:13.169 --> 00:21:16.639
I was petting my walrus all morning
and thinking of you the whole time.

317
00:21:17.609 --> 00:21:20.282
Okay, pervert.
I think that you should leave.

318
00:21:20.769 --> 00:21:23.841
What? I was joking because
of what we talked about yesterday.

319
00:21:24.209 --> 00:21:26.120
Yesterday?

320
00:21:26.769 --> 00:21:28.680
I've never even met you.

321
00:21:28.849 --> 00:21:32.319
- Nick! I need help!
- Coming, Lucy.

322
00:21:32.849 --> 00:21:34.601
Nick, put that down.
I'll handle it.

323
00:21:34.769 --> 00:21:37.966
- You, follow me.
- Wait a... What's going on?

324
00:21:38.129 --> 00:21:40.199
I was kidding around with you!

325
00:21:40.649 --> 00:21:44.244
What's happening here?
Is she crazy or something?

326
00:21:44.409 --> 00:21:49.085
Lucy is a very special person.
Very different from other people.

327
00:21:49.449 --> 00:21:50.928
Okay.

328
00:21:51.089 --> 00:21:54.923
About a year ago, Lucy was
in a terrible car accident.

329
00:21:55.089 --> 00:21:58.445
She and her father went up
North Shore to get a pineapple.

330
00:22:33.889 --> 00:22:38.360
Her father broke some ribs, but Lucy
suffered a serious head injury.

331
00:22:38.609 --> 00:22:41.077
She lost her short-term memory.

332
00:22:41.809 --> 00:22:43.401
So she can't remember anything?

333
00:22:43.569 --> 00:22:46.129
No, no, no, she has all of her
long-term memory.

334
00:22:46.289 --> 00:22:48.041
That's a different part
of the brain.

335
00:22:48.209 --> 00:22:52.202
Her whole life, up to the night before
the accident, she remembers.

336
00:22:52.369 --> 00:22:55.042
She just can't retain
any new information.

337
00:22:55.209 --> 00:22:59.680
It's like her slate gets wiped clean
every night while she sleeps.

338
00:22:59.849 --> 00:23:03.000
Hold on. This sounds like something
I would tell a psycho girl...

339
00:23:03.169 --> 00:23:05.637
...so she'd stop calling me.
Am I the psycho girl?

340
00:23:05.809 --> 00:23:07.640
I wish I was making this up!

341
00:23:07.809 --> 00:23:10.448
She has no memory
that she ever met you.

342
00:23:10.609 --> 00:23:12.600
What about the
pineapple-picking thing?

343
00:23:12.769 --> 00:23:15.078
She says that every day,
because each morning...

344
00:23:15.249 --> 00:23:18.400
...she wakes up thinking it's
October 13th of last year.

345
00:23:18.569 --> 00:23:21.720
She comes for breakfast because
that's what she did on Sundays...

346
00:23:21.889 --> 00:23:24.039
...and October 13th
was a Sunday.

347
00:23:24.209 --> 00:23:27.679
She has no idea
it's more than a year later.

348
00:23:27.849 --> 00:23:29.328
She reads the newspaper.

349
00:23:29.489 --> 00:23:32.287
It's a special paper her father
puts on their porch.

350
00:23:32.449 --> 00:23:35.725
It's from the day of her accident.
He got hundreds of them printed.

351
00:23:36.049 --> 00:23:40.486
Lucy does the same thing every day.

352
00:23:50.049 --> 00:23:51.846
- Hello!
- Back here.

353
00:23:52.009 --> 00:23:55.206
- Hi, Dad!
- Oh, hi, sweetie.

354
00:23:55.369 --> 00:23:57.405
You got one without me.

355
00:23:58.169 --> 00:24:01.479
The lady at the farmers' market
gave it to me as a birthday present.

356
00:24:01.649 --> 00:24:04.209
I didn't wanna hurt her feelings.

357
00:24:06.009 --> 00:24:07.727
I think she likes you.

358
00:24:07.889 --> 00:24:11.245
- Yeah, what's not to like?
- What about our tradition?

359
00:24:11.409 --> 00:24:15.243
Well, I have another idea.
I painted my workshop yesterday.

360
00:24:16.009 --> 00:24:17.727
White.

361
00:24:18.129 --> 00:24:20.404
Now it's too white.
Gives me a headache.

362
00:24:20.569 --> 00:24:23.037
Oh, yeah, you definitely
need some colour in here.

363
00:24:23.209 --> 00:24:26.087
Well, you know,
that's what I was thinking.

364
00:24:26.409 --> 00:24:28.240
- Really?
- Yeah. Go nuts.

365
00:24:28.409 --> 00:24:31.685
- Paint me something for my birthday.
- I will.

366
00:24:32.249 --> 00:24:35.480
And promise that we can pick
a pineapple for Thanksgiving, okay?

367
00:24:35.649 --> 00:24:38.607
- Sounds great.
- Okay, good.

368
00:24:38.769 --> 00:24:41.966
Hey, you should watch the Vikings
game while I'm painting.

369
00:24:42.689 --> 00:24:44.441
Good idea.

370
00:24:48.689 --> 00:24:52.523
- Yeah, baby. Isolate.
- What are we eating tonight, Doug?

371
00:24:52.689 --> 00:24:55.078
- Spaghetti, Pop.
- Try not to sweat in the sauce.

372
00:24:55.569 --> 00:24:56.968
Sorry, Pop.

373
00:25:03.889 --> 00:25:05.322
Go Vikings.

374
00:25:06.169 --> 00:25:09.320
Seven hundred and five.
Seven hundred and six.

375
00:25:09.489 --> 00:25:11.719
- Seven hundred and seven.
- Hey, you guys.

376
00:25:11.969 --> 00:25:13.960
Hey, sweetie.
How's the painting coming?

377
00:25:14.129 --> 00:25:15.926
- You'll see.
- Cool.

378
00:25:16.089 --> 00:25:19.161
- Oh. What's the score?
- The Vikings are on the two-yard line.

379
00:25:19.329 --> 00:25:23.083
- Lf they score, they bring it to 14-10.
- Maybe they'll win for your birthday.

380
00:25:23.969 --> 00:25:26.199
And I'll bet Culpepper runs it in.

381
00:25:26.369 --> 00:25:30.442
I'll bet he fakes a handoff to Williams,
throws to Kleinsasser in the end zone.

382
00:25:30.609 --> 00:25:33.248
- Loser does the dishes?
- You're on.

383
00:25:33.409 --> 00:25:35.240
- K eep the offence on the field

384
00:25:35.409 --> 00:25:38.082
Culpepper fak es a handoff
to Williams He will throw

385
00:25:38.249 --> 00:25:41.082
He's got Kleinsasser in the end zone!
Touchdown, Minnesota

386
00:25:41.249 --> 00:25:42.602
Doug, you're good.

387
00:25:43.729 --> 00:25:45.401
Maybe you should be a coach.

388
00:25:49.649 --> 00:25:51.799
- Dad.
- Moron!

389
00:25:51.969 --> 00:25:53.561
That hurt.

390
00:26:06.289 --> 00:26:07.881
And you don't look a day over 25.

391
00:26:08.049 --> 00:26:11.200
Yeah, right, and Doug's muscles
aren't pharmaceutically enhanced.

392
00:26:11.369 --> 00:26:12.961
What? I use an herb supplement...

393
00:26:13.129 --> 00:26:16.326
...that can be purchased at any
health-food store. Check this out.

394
00:26:16.489 --> 00:26:19.162
Check out these glutes.
Rock-hard, baby.

395
00:26:19.409 --> 00:26:20.603
Pretty sweet, huh?

396
00:26:20.769 --> 00:26:23.408
Stop it! You're gonna make me
throw up on the cake.

397
00:26:23.569 --> 00:26:25.002
Okay, just open your present.

398
00:26:25.169 --> 00:26:27.888
Okay. Let's see what we've got here.

399
00:26:29.089 --> 00:26:30.761
The Sixth Sense

400
00:26:31.289 --> 00:26:34.679
Hey! When I'm done doing the dishes,
do you guys wanna watch it?

401
00:26:35.249 --> 00:26:36.602
- Sure.
- Sure.

402
00:26:37.529 --> 00:26:39.645
Ben Friedkin?

403
00:26:39.809 --> 00:26:43.006
Some people, they call me freak

404
00:26:43.969 --> 00:26:49.168
- Ronald Sumner?
- I am I am a freak Look at me

405
00:26:50.009 --> 00:26:51.328
Just give me a chance...

406
00:26:55.609 --> 00:26:59.045
I can't believe it.
Bruce Willis is a ghost.

407
00:26:59.209 --> 00:27:01.325
I'm shocked.
Did you see that coming?

408
00:27:01.489 --> 00:27:02.524
- No.
- Not a clue.

409
00:27:02.689 --> 00:27:05.726
- Shocked as hell.
- Anyway, it was awesome.

410
00:27:05.889 --> 00:27:07.720
- Happy birthday.
- Love you, Sis.

411
00:27:07.889 --> 00:27:11.564
Your muscles are getting so big, I can
barely wrap my arms around you.

412
00:27:11.729 --> 00:27:13.401
You like that?
Check this out.

413
00:27:17.729 --> 00:27:21.881
Okay, okay! Enough with the titty
dance! Let your sister go to sleep.

414
00:27:22.049 --> 00:27:23.846
- I like it.
- Sweet dreams, Lucy.

415
00:27:24.009 --> 00:27:25.965
- Good night.
- Good night.

416
00:28:13.969 --> 00:28:15.607
Hey, Tracy, how you doing?

417
00:28:15.769 --> 00:28:16.963
Yeah?

418
00:28:17.129 --> 00:28:20.007
Well, things changed a little bit
since high school.

419
00:28:48.169 --> 00:28:50.888
And this is what happens
every single day.

420
00:28:51.049 --> 00:28:53.483
How long it gonna take for
her memory to come back?

421
00:28:53.649 --> 00:28:55.879
Her doctors say it may
never come back.

422
00:28:56.049 --> 00:28:59.041
So, basically,
what you're saying is...

423
00:29:00.049 --> 00:29:02.279
...she's perfect for you.
- What do you mean?

424
00:29:02.449 --> 00:29:05.009
You can hang out all day with
no attachment, because...

425
00:29:05.169 --> 00:29:08.002
Her plane leaves every night?
There's a problem with that.

426
00:29:08.169 --> 00:29:09.761
- What is?
- It's evil.

427
00:29:09.929 --> 00:29:11.078
No, it isn't.

428
00:29:11.249 --> 00:29:14.480
You meet her, hang out, flirt,
no commitment, nobody gets hurt.

429
00:29:14.649 --> 00:29:18.437
- She's got brain damage, you psycho.
- Okay, I'll give you that one.

430
00:29:18.609 --> 00:29:20.361
But I think it'd be healthy for you.

431
00:29:20.529 --> 00:29:23.407
You haven't allowed yourself
to connect with a girl.

432
00:29:23.569 --> 00:29:25.958
I appreciate your interest,
but leave me alone.

433
00:29:26.129 --> 00:29:28.518
Hey, you'd be doing exactly
what her father does:

434
00:29:29.129 --> 00:29:30.881
Giving her a wonderful day.

435
00:29:31.049 --> 00:29:34.962
When it's time for you to go on your
big boat trip, poof, you just leave.

436
00:29:35.129 --> 00:29:36.847
She'll never even know you're gone.

437
00:29:37.009 --> 00:29:40.206
I'm not sure about the "poofing" part,
because I'm not a good poofer.

438
00:29:40.369 --> 00:29:41.882
Demonstrate a good poof for me?

439
00:29:42.049 --> 00:29:44.609
Quit busting my coconuts
for five seconds.

440
00:29:44.769 --> 00:29:48.045
All right. Would you stop poofing
on that joint and do some work?

441
00:29:48.689 --> 00:29:52.318
Okay. Let's get this sucker ready.

442
00:29:52.489 --> 00:29:55.242
Then we're gonna take her
out for a spin.

443
00:29:57.609 --> 00:30:00.567
Captain's log: November 7 th
Nearly midnight

444
00:30:00.729 --> 00:30:03.323
The Sea Serpent is fully
recovered from her mishap

445
00:30:03.489 --> 00:30:06.447
and ready to once again
brave the open ocean

446
00:30:08.929 --> 00:30:11.568
I think my stitches
opened up again, cuz.

447
00:30:11.729 --> 00:30:14.846
You got a cat?
Because I feel something licking me.

448
00:30:25.689 --> 00:30:27.088
How is it?

449
00:30:27.249 --> 00:30:29.365
Peanut Butter Cups.
What are you doing here?

450
00:30:29.529 --> 00:30:31.804
I just wanted to say hi to Lucy.

451
00:30:33.609 --> 00:30:35.804
I promise you I'm not gonna
do anything wrong.

452
00:30:35.969 --> 00:30:37.163
What did Sue say?

453
00:30:37.329 --> 00:30:40.685
She said that if I talk to Lucy,
you'll kill me with a meat cleaver.

454
00:30:40.849 --> 00:30:43.727
She's the boss, cuz.
But don't worry.

455
00:30:43.889 --> 00:30:46.244
Lucy probably didn't wanna
talk to you anyway.

456
00:30:47.889 --> 00:30:50.039
- What does that mean?
- This ain't a disco.

457
00:30:50.209 --> 00:30:53.007
She doesn't want guys hitting on her
during her breakfast.

458
00:30:53.489 --> 00:30:54.888
She does if it's Henry Roth.

459
00:30:55.049 --> 00:30:56.687
- Who that?
- Who that? Me that.

460
00:30:56.849 --> 00:31:00.637
I bet you 20 bucks I can get her
to have breakfast with me again.

461
00:31:03.209 --> 00:31:05.564
- You're on.
- I love it.

462
00:31:06.329 --> 00:31:10.083
- How you doing, honey?
- Hey, Sue. Nice haircut.

463
00:31:10.249 --> 00:31:13.002
Oh, mahalo.
See you in a bit.

464
00:31:13.169 --> 00:31:17.082
Nick and I have an arrangement.
You can trust me.

465
00:31:17.249 --> 00:31:19.080
Don't worry.

466
00:31:40.529 --> 00:31:42.838
You should try this out.
Put it in there.

467
00:31:43.009 --> 00:31:45.079
Swivelly door.

468
00:31:45.249 --> 00:31:47.558
Waffleonians can
come in and out now.

469
00:31:48.369 --> 00:31:51.441
Are you from a country where it's
okay to stick your fingers...

470
00:31:51.609 --> 00:31:53.167
...all over someone else's food?

471
00:31:54.249 --> 00:31:56.365
No, I'm from this country.

472
00:31:56.529 --> 00:31:58.838
Why? Were you gonna eat that? Oh.

473
00:31:59.009 --> 00:32:01.159
All right, well, have a good meal.

474
00:32:06.449 --> 00:32:08.565
- Yeah.
- That was pathetic.

475
00:32:08.729 --> 00:32:10.720
Yeah? Why don't you choke
on your Spam?

476
00:32:10.889 --> 00:32:12.720
Double or nothing tomorrow.

477
00:32:20.129 --> 00:32:22.324
Hey. I'm sorry to bother you...

478
00:32:22.489 --> 00:32:25.242
...but you look like a person
who appreciates fine art...

479
00:32:25.409 --> 00:32:27.081
...so I wanted your opinion.

480
00:32:27.249 --> 00:32:33.438
I drew this. It's a picture of a father
and son fishing off a fishing boat.

481
00:32:33.769 --> 00:32:35.361
There's a walrus right there...

482
00:32:40.649 --> 00:32:43.561
Oh, you don't speak English. Okay.

483
00:32:46.209 --> 00:32:48.643
Doesn't look Chinese.

484
00:32:48.809 --> 00:32:50.845
Forty.

485
00:32:52.289 --> 00:32:53.608
Can I have that?

486
00:32:53.769 --> 00:32:56.488
I need something
to wipe my ass with.

487
00:32:56.769 --> 00:32:58.043
Shut up.

488
00:33:22.329 --> 00:33:24.206
I wonder what's the matter with him.

489
00:33:24.369 --> 00:33:26.758
Looks like a stupid asshole to me.

490
00:33:33.649 --> 00:33:36.117
Excuse me. Okay.
I didn't mean to startle you.

491
00:33:36.289 --> 00:33:38.245
- No, that's all right. L...
- Are you okay?

492
00:33:38.409 --> 00:33:41.082
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm having
a problem with something...

493
00:33:41.249 --> 00:33:43.046
Something that I could help you with?

494
00:33:43.209 --> 00:33:44.927
No, no, no. I just...

495
00:33:45.089 --> 00:33:47.887
...can't read.

496
00:33:48.929 --> 00:33:51.045
You gotta be kidding me.

497
00:33:51.209 --> 00:33:53.165
- I can read that for you.
- No. Thank you.

498
00:33:53.329 --> 00:33:55.001
I can do this on my own.

499
00:33:55.169 --> 00:33:57.125
Appreciate the sentiment.

500
00:33:57.289 --> 00:33:59.757
I'm gonna get an order of the...

501
00:34:10.089 --> 00:34:11.158
Pan...

502
00:34:11.529 --> 00:34:13.121
Pan...

503
00:34:15.249 --> 00:34:16.762
Panku...

504
00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:17.998
Ca...

505
00:34:18.569 --> 00:34:20.048
Panclocks.

506
00:34:20.209 --> 00:34:22.769
- Pancakes.
- Okay, I'll have pancake.

507
00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:25.204
- Pancakes.
- Pancah... Pancakes! Pancakes!

508
00:34:25.369 --> 00:34:26.927
- I'm so stupid!
- Oh, don't cry.

509
00:34:27.089 --> 00:34:30.604
- Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.
- Don't cry.

510
00:34:30.769 --> 00:34:33.442
- I don't know anything!
- What a loser.

511
00:34:37.289 --> 00:34:39.484
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you sit with me?

512
00:34:39.649 --> 00:34:43.039
You can have some breakfast and
I'll help teach you some of the words.

513
00:34:43.289 --> 00:34:45.007
- Okay.
- All right.

514
00:34:45.169 --> 00:34:47.000
- That sounds nice.
- Come on over.

515
00:34:47.169 --> 00:34:49.125
- Okay, thank you.
- All right.

516
00:34:55.009 --> 00:34:58.206
So I comes before the E?

517
00:34:58.369 --> 00:35:00.564
- Except after C?
- Yes.

518
00:35:00.729 --> 00:35:03.402
Okay, and C is that little
half a squiggly one, right?

519
00:35:03.569 --> 00:35:05.639
- Yes.
- I think I'm getting it.

520
00:35:05.809 --> 00:35:09.165
- How'd you get so good at teaching?
- I'm a teacher. I do it all the time.

521
00:35:09.329 --> 00:35:12.002
I'm an art teacher at
the Haluki-liki Junior High.

522
00:35:12.169 --> 00:35:16.048
Well, you Haluki-liki the kind of
teacher all the kids have crushes on.

523
00:35:16.209 --> 00:35:18.598
I know I would if I was in your class.

524
00:35:22.289 --> 00:35:24.041
Okay.

525
00:35:24.209 --> 00:35:26.723
Oh, boy, do my...
My fingers smell like fish.

526
00:35:26.889 --> 00:35:28.641
That doesn't gross you out, does it?

527
00:35:28.809 --> 00:35:30.481
No, not at all.

528
00:35:30.649 --> 00:35:32.401
Really?

529
00:35:35.049 --> 00:35:37.961
If Lucy gets hurt, I'm gonna chop you
with the meat cleaver.

530
00:35:38.129 --> 00:35:39.642
Okay, okay.

531
00:35:41.409 --> 00:35:42.967
So I had a nice time.

532
00:35:43.129 --> 00:35:45.768
- Yeah, me too.
- Thank you very much.

533
00:35:45.929 --> 00:35:47.567
- Let me get it for you.
- Thank you.

534
00:35:47.729 --> 00:35:49.242
Sure.

535
00:35:49.409 --> 00:35:51.127
Okay.

536
00:35:57.809 --> 00:36:02.599
I just want to eat you up, tomorrow
and the next day, next day, next day...

537
00:36:03.729 --> 00:36:05.560
I'll see you around.

538
00:36:05.729 --> 00:36:07.367
Okay.

539
00:36:11.089 --> 00:36:12.488
Really? That's it?

540
00:36:13.169 --> 00:36:16.241
- That's what?
- All that flirting...

541
00:36:16.409 --> 00:36:19.719
...and phoney "I can't read" stuff,
and you're not gonna ask me out...

542
00:36:19.889 --> 00:36:21.163
...or for my phone number?

543
00:36:21.329 --> 00:36:23.559
- I can't read.
- Oh, shut up.

544
00:36:23.729 --> 00:36:26.926
That was one of the goofiest things
I've ever seen, but I thought:

545
00:36:27.089 --> 00:36:29.808
"Hey, if this guy is so desperate
to meet me...

546
00:36:29.969 --> 00:36:32.199
...he might be worth talking to."

547
00:36:32.369 --> 00:36:34.121
But then I get stiffed.

548
00:36:34.409 --> 00:36:36.479
No, no, no,
this is what happened. I...

549
00:36:36.849 --> 00:36:39.079
Mahalo for the ego boost.

550
00:36:39.249 --> 00:36:42.241
- You're right. You're right. I feel like...
- No worries.

551
00:36:43.049 --> 00:36:45.005
I gotta...
I can read a little!

552
00:36:45.169 --> 00:36:48.479
I didn't know I came before E!
That one I didn't know, I swear.

553
00:36:48.649 --> 00:36:50.401
Oh, you idiot.

554
00:36:50.569 --> 00:36:52.639
I hope you're happy, Shamu.

555
00:36:56.849 --> 00:36:58.282
Marlin. It's Sue.

556
00:37:09.969 --> 00:37:13.962
- Oh, aloha, sir. My name's Henry...
- I know who you are.

557
00:37:15.729 --> 00:37:18.562
- I want to apologize to your daughter.
- Not gonna happen.

558
00:37:18.729 --> 00:37:21.118
She's inside.
We're gonna straighten things out.

559
00:37:21.289 --> 00:37:24.440
Dad, the damn mongoose
got in the garbage again!

560
00:37:26.289 --> 00:37:28.200
- Is this the guy?
- Yeah.

561
00:37:28.369 --> 00:37:31.042
Mr. Roth, I have one simple request:

562
00:37:31.409 --> 00:37:32.967
Stay away from my daughter.

563
00:37:33.129 --> 00:37:36.519
Absolutely. I hurt her feelings
and don't want it to end like that.

564
00:37:36.689 --> 00:37:37.963
It's gonna end like this.

565
00:37:39.209 --> 00:37:40.642
Calm down, little fellow.

566
00:37:40.809 --> 00:37:43.881
I'm gonna kill you! You're a dead man.
Okay, I'm calm.

567
00:37:44.049 --> 00:37:45.607
I'm calm.

568
00:37:45.969 --> 00:37:48.199
- Let me help you up.
- I got it! I got it.

569
00:37:48.369 --> 00:37:52.681
It's just Dad and I work too hard
to protect Lucy to let some idiot ruin it.

570
00:37:52.849 --> 00:37:55.363
I know what you guys do
and I totally respect that.

571
00:37:55.529 --> 00:37:59.078
If you know her condition, you know
she can't have a normal relationship.

572
00:37:59.249 --> 00:38:01.319
The next morning,
she won't know who he is.

573
00:38:01.489 --> 00:38:03.480
And any guy who's okay with that...

574
00:38:03.649 --> 00:38:05.082
...ain't okay with me.

575
00:38:05.289 --> 00:38:09.077
- I'm not looking for a one-night stand.
- Anything with Lucy is, numb-nuts.

576
00:38:09.249 --> 00:38:12.764
Give us a break.
Just stay away from the Hukilau Café.

577
00:38:13.329 --> 00:38:15.240
My daughter's been through enough.

578
00:38:16.849 --> 00:38:18.441
Okay. I'm sorry.

579
00:38:23.089 --> 00:38:26.126
I could have whooped his ass,
but this gravel, I slipped on it...

580
00:38:26.289 --> 00:38:29.087
Yeah, well, maybe you need to do
a few more butt flexes.

581
00:38:29.689 --> 00:38:31.088
Cheap shot, Dad.

582
00:38:32.049 --> 00:38:33.641
So fresh and so clean.

583
00:38:33.809 --> 00:38:36.801
Hey, Alexa, did you hook up
with that girl from the bar?

584
00:38:36.969 --> 00:38:39.039
- I chickened out.
- Really?

585
00:38:39.209 --> 00:38:42.087
Yeah, I don't know.
I guess I prefer sausage to taco.

586
00:38:43.329 --> 00:38:45.763
- What?
- Yeah. No, I agree, buddy.

587
00:38:45.929 --> 00:38:48.682
Get out of here.
Run for the hills.

588
00:38:49.449 --> 00:38:51.167
Let me ask you something, Alexa.

589
00:38:51.329 --> 00:38:54.207
If you promised a girl's dad
that you wouldn't see her...

590
00:38:54.369 --> 00:38:56.564
...would you consider that
a binding promise?

591
00:38:56.729 --> 00:38:58.208
- Absolutely.
- Yeah?

592
00:38:58.369 --> 00:39:00.963
Then again, there are always ways
around such things.

593
00:39:01.129 --> 00:39:02.801
- Like?
- For example...

594
00:39:02.969 --> 00:39:07.087
...if I promised a woman's father
I would not see her...

595
00:39:07.249 --> 00:39:10.924
...I would simply shut my eyes
while she serviced my manhood.

596
00:39:12.849 --> 00:39:14.840
That's actually a cool way to look at it.

597
00:39:15.009 --> 00:39:16.727
And a very gross way.

598
00:39:32.369 --> 00:39:35.202
He asked me not to go to the Hukilau.
I'm not going there.

599
00:39:35.769 --> 00:39:37.282
I'm not doing anything wrong.

600
00:39:44.009 --> 00:39:46.125
Sorry to bother you.
I'm kind of stuck here.

601
00:39:47.089 --> 00:39:49.967
- Car trouble?
- Yeah. You mind giving me a jump?

602
00:39:50.489 --> 00:39:51.888
Okay.

603
00:39:52.049 --> 00:39:53.641
Appreciate your time.

604
00:39:53.809 --> 00:39:55.401
Not everybody would have stopped.

605
00:39:55.569 --> 00:39:57.525
- You're real sweet.
- Oh, yeah. Thank you.

606
00:40:03.649 --> 00:40:06.038
I can't believe you fell for that.

607
00:40:06.929 --> 00:40:09.887
Well, my grandfather died
trying to jump-start a car.

608
00:40:13.769 --> 00:40:16.647
I'm sorry.
I was just joking around.

609
00:40:16.809 --> 00:40:20.040
I can't believe you fell for that!

610
00:40:20.209 --> 00:40:21.847
Oh, my God.

611
00:40:22.009 --> 00:40:23.522
That was very good.

612
00:40:23.689 --> 00:40:25.759
- My name's Henry.
- I'm Lucy.

613
00:40:25.929 --> 00:40:27.965
Nice to meet you.
You look like a nice...

614
00:40:33.809 --> 00:40:37.006
Hi. Sorry for the delay.
Should be a few minutes.

615
00:40:37.169 --> 00:40:39.524
- No problem. No worries.
- Where you coming from?

616
00:40:40.129 --> 00:40:41.687
Breakfast?

617
00:40:41.849 --> 00:40:43.248
- Yeah.
- How was it?

618
00:40:43.409 --> 00:40:45.127
I had waffles. They were delicious.

619
00:40:45.289 --> 00:40:47.564
I like making little houses
out of waffles.

620
00:40:49.169 --> 00:40:51.888
- You do?
- That's my thing.

621
00:40:53.929 --> 00:40:55.248
- What's your name?
- Lucy.

622
00:40:55.409 --> 00:40:56.683
Hi, I'm Henry.

623
00:40:56.849 --> 00:40:59.727
Okay, pal. When she stops,
just let her pet you. Look cute.

624
00:40:59.889 --> 00:41:02.926
Go to the middle of the road.
Thank you. Right there. Perfect.

625
00:41:09.169 --> 00:41:11.888
- Oh, shit.
- Here she comes. Smile.

626
00:41:15.089 --> 00:41:16.522
Where is she?

627
00:41:19.649 --> 00:41:21.446
Oh, my God. Oh, no!

628
00:41:23.529 --> 00:41:25.326
Okay. That didn't work.

629
00:41:25.489 --> 00:41:28.208
Shit your pants? So did I.

630
00:41:33.489 --> 00:41:35.400
Okay, this is her.
Start beating me up.

631
00:41:35.569 --> 00:41:37.161
Make it look good.

632
00:41:40.289 --> 00:41:41.847
Give me your wallet!

633
00:41:42.409 --> 00:41:45.367
Okay, haole, what do you think?
You can come to this island...

634
00:41:45.529 --> 00:41:48.327
...eat our pineapple...
- Help me! Not so hard.

635
00:41:48.489 --> 00:41:50.445
- Take it easy.
- Try to bang our women.

636
00:41:50.649 --> 00:41:52.844
Making my sister
clean your hotel room.

637
00:41:53.009 --> 00:41:55.204
Okay. What's that have to do
with this? Relax.

638
00:41:55.369 --> 00:41:57.758
- Hey! Hey! Help me, please!
- Stupid haole!

639
00:41:58.889 --> 00:42:01.961
Yeah, that's right. Take that!
And that! And that!

640
00:42:02.129 --> 00:42:03.528
And that! And that!

641
00:42:03.689 --> 00:42:05.839
You got him. You got him.
Enough. Enough.

642
00:42:06.009 --> 00:42:07.237
- Are you okay?
- Yes, yes...

643
00:42:07.409 --> 00:42:08.842
Okay, I'll be back.
Come here!

644
00:42:09.009 --> 00:42:10.601
No, no! I think he's had enough.

645
00:42:11.409 --> 00:42:12.922
I'm sorry.

646
00:42:13.969 --> 00:42:16.085
My eye!

647
00:42:17.289 --> 00:42:19.405
- You got him!
- Not good enough!

648
00:42:19.569 --> 00:42:20.797
Oh, Kamehameha!

649
00:42:20.969 --> 00:42:22.925
He learned his lesson!

650
00:42:23.329 --> 00:42:25.320
- What's your name?
- My name's Henry.

651
00:42:25.489 --> 00:42:27.241
- You did good.
- Hi. Sorry.

652
00:42:27.409 --> 00:42:29.047
I'm in a community-watch program...

653
00:42:29.249 --> 00:42:31.240
Oh, you crazy bitch!

654
00:42:31.409 --> 00:42:33.081
Yeah, keep running!

655
00:42:33.249 --> 00:42:35.558
Okay, okay, he's... He's gone now.

656
00:42:42.089 --> 00:42:43.841
Not her. False alarm.

657
00:42:47.529 --> 00:42:50.487
Don't worry, I called the cops already.
I'm all set.

658
00:42:50.649 --> 00:42:53.163
Yeah? You all set for this, Mr. Smarty?

659
00:42:55.729 --> 00:42:57.560
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

660
00:42:57.729 --> 00:43:01.119
When you're finished playing your
kidnap-victim crap on my daughter...

661
00:43:01.289 --> 00:43:02.438
...come by the house.

662
00:43:02.609 --> 00:43:04.645
Okay.

663
00:43:11.929 --> 00:43:13.408
Oh, boy.

664
00:43:20.689 --> 00:43:22.407
There's something I wanna show you.

665
00:43:32.489 --> 00:43:35.447
We figured it out. She only sings
on days she meets you.

666
00:43:35.609 --> 00:43:37.486
You're kidding me. That song?

667
00:43:37.649 --> 00:43:39.048
That's Mom and Dad's song.

668
00:43:39.209 --> 00:43:42.121
When her mom was alive,
Lucy would have me take that tape...

669
00:43:42.289 --> 00:43:44.757
...on every fishing trip I went on.
- Oh, yeah?

670
00:43:44.929 --> 00:43:47.159
Yeah, she knew it would make me
miss her mom...

671
00:43:47.329 --> 00:43:49.001
...and want to come home sooner.

672
00:43:49.169 --> 00:43:53.162
I'm seeing a new side to you, sir.
I gotta tell you, it's grossing me out.

673
00:43:54.889 --> 00:43:56.163
Let me ask you something.

674
00:43:56.329 --> 00:43:59.401
What's in it for you?
What do you get out of this?

675
00:44:01.009 --> 00:44:02.283
I don't know.

676
00:44:07.169 --> 00:44:09.603
Wouldn't you want to spend
an hour a day with that?

677
00:44:09.769 --> 00:44:12.488
Actually, no. She sings like shit.

678
00:44:12.849 --> 00:44:15.204
- What?
- Can I ask you guys something?

679
00:44:15.369 --> 00:44:18.088
What'll happen down the line?
Someday she'll wake up...

680
00:44:18.249 --> 00:44:21.321
...look in the mirror and notice
she aged 10 years overnight.

681
00:44:21.569 --> 00:44:23.605
You know something, Henry?

682
00:44:23.769 --> 00:44:26.442
I worry about that
every damn day of my life.

683
00:44:31.249 --> 00:44:32.682
Pardon me.

684
00:44:32.849 --> 00:44:35.841
Sorry to interrupt, but I noticed we
were both eating alone...

685
00:44:36.009 --> 00:44:39.319
...and I thought I could sit with you,
maybe build a syrup Jacuzzi...

686
00:44:39.489 --> 00:44:42.606
...for your waffle house?
- Oh, that would be nice...

687
00:44:42.769 --> 00:44:44.964
...but I have a boyfriend.

688
00:44:45.129 --> 00:44:47.085
So I'm sorry.

689
00:44:48.849 --> 00:44:51.079
You're making up a boyfriend
to get rid of me?

690
00:44:51.249 --> 00:44:52.602
No, I'm not.

691
00:44:52.769 --> 00:44:54.760
What's his name, then?

692
00:44:54.929 --> 00:44:56.157
Ringo.

693
00:44:56.849 --> 00:44:58.362
Is his last name Starr?

694
00:44:58.689 --> 00:45:01.567
- No. McCartney.
- McCartney, okay.

695
00:45:02.209 --> 00:45:03.961
- Oh, no.
- All right. I'm sorry.

696
00:45:04.129 --> 00:45:06.438
No! This cop is writing me a ticket!

697
00:45:06.609 --> 00:45:08.520
Oh, whoa, whoa.
I wouldn't go out there.

698
00:45:08.689 --> 00:45:10.008
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Go on!

699
00:45:10.169 --> 00:45:11.488
I'm coming.

700
00:45:11.649 --> 00:45:13.560
The tags don't expire
for seven months.

701
00:45:13.729 --> 00:45:16.402
- They expired May of this year.
- No! No, no!

702
00:45:16.569 --> 00:45:17.968
They expire May of next year.

703
00:45:18.129 --> 00:45:20.040
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

704
00:45:20.209 --> 00:45:21.881
- I don't.
- This is ridiculous.

705
00:45:22.049 --> 00:45:24.199
I'm not paying for this!
It's October!

706
00:45:24.529 --> 00:45:26.884
Excuse me. Can I borrow this?
Look, October!

707
00:45:27.049 --> 00:45:28.846
Lucy, let's go back inside.

708
00:45:29.969 --> 00:45:31.607
What?

709
00:45:41.129 --> 00:45:42.562
What?

710
00:45:48.769 --> 00:45:50.805
Having a bad day, Doug!

711
00:46:30.289 --> 00:46:32.007
Sweetheart...

712
00:46:32.769 --> 00:46:34.441
...these are from the accident.

713
00:46:51.049 --> 00:46:53.643
Oh, no!

714
00:47:00.489 --> 00:47:02.764
I can feel it.

715
00:47:04.969 --> 00:47:08.359
You were in the hospital
for three months, sweetheart.

716
00:47:20.929 --> 00:47:24.968
I have to talk to this doctor.
I need to hear it from him.

717
00:47:25.129 --> 00:47:27.040
You have heard it, sweetie.
Many times.

718
00:47:28.849 --> 00:47:30.202
I have?

719
00:47:31.689 --> 00:47:33.168
I'll take her.

720
00:47:34.609 --> 00:47:37.169
I have to hear for myself too.

721
00:47:47.449 --> 00:47:49.565
Doug, just take this, okay?
I can't...

722
00:47:49.729 --> 00:47:52.289
I can't look at it anymore.

723
00:47:52.769 --> 00:47:56.239
- It's gonna be all right, Luce.
- Don't call me Luce. I barely know you.

724
00:47:56.689 --> 00:47:58.805
Sweetie, you're sort of dating him.

725
00:48:00.169 --> 00:48:02.444
Sorry I'm not better-looking.

726
00:48:04.369 --> 00:48:06.929
What else happened
since last October?

727
00:48:07.089 --> 00:48:10.718
- What about my students?
- Miss Campbell took over your class.

728
00:48:13.649 --> 00:48:16.447
- Did Alicia marry that guy?
- Yeah.

729
00:48:16.609 --> 00:48:18.884
Doug, did you win
the Mr. Hawaii contest?

730
00:48:19.049 --> 00:48:21.244
I didn't know there was gonna be
a urine test.

731
00:48:21.769 --> 00:48:22.918
Wow.

732
00:48:24.009 --> 00:48:25.328
Do we have sex?

733
00:48:27.209 --> 00:48:30.918
No, we don't.
Just so everybody knows that.

734
00:48:31.569 --> 00:48:32.718
We want to.

735
00:48:34.129 --> 00:48:35.721
Just kidding.

736
00:48:39.649 --> 00:48:43.198
So you guys have to just lie
to me every day.

737
00:48:56.049 --> 00:48:58.085
Hey, Lucy.
Good to see you again.

738
00:49:01.209 --> 00:49:03.245
What the hell's her problem?

739
00:49:03.409 --> 00:49:05.798
She doesn't remember
who you are, brah.

740
00:49:05.969 --> 00:49:07.766
Oh, yeah.

741
00:49:07.929 --> 00:49:10.602
I suck at this job.

742
00:49:11.929 --> 00:49:13.806
Lucy, these are your
brain scans here.

743
00:49:13.969 --> 00:49:15.880
I'm afraid they show
no improvement.

744
00:49:16.049 --> 00:49:18.438
The temporal lobe
was severely damaged.

745
00:49:18.609 --> 00:49:21.726
What we believe is scar tissue
here is impairing your ability...

746
00:49:21.889 --> 00:49:25.404
...to convert short-term memory into
long-term memory while you sleep.

747
00:49:25.569 --> 00:49:28.208
The condition's come to be known
as Goldfield Syndrome.

748
00:49:28.369 --> 00:49:31.441
- Who's Goldfield?
- A brilliant Lithuanian psychiatrist.

749
00:49:31.609 --> 00:49:33.565
He himself suffered
temporal-lobe damage.

750
00:49:33.729 --> 00:49:35.720
Took him four years
to publish his findings...

751
00:49:35.889 --> 00:49:38.449
...because he had to keep
starting over from scratch.

752
00:49:38.929 --> 00:49:42.126
Obviously, your sense of humour
is still intact, and that's here.

753
00:49:42.289 --> 00:49:44.007
Magnificent amygdala as well.

754
00:49:44.169 --> 00:49:46.922
- Doctor, I have a question.
- I'd be happy to answer it...

755
00:49:47.089 --> 00:49:51.321
...but as I've told you before, this is a
hygienic facility. Shirts are required.

756
00:49:51.489 --> 00:49:52.842
- Oh, okay.
- Nice move.

757
00:49:54.889 --> 00:49:56.527
Listen, doctor, this...

758
00:49:56.689 --> 00:50:00.159
...friend of mine's been experimenting
a little with steroids.

759
00:50:00.329 --> 00:50:02.126
He's been having a lot
of wet dreams.

760
00:50:02.529 --> 00:50:04.485
Could there be a connection
between them?

761
00:50:04.649 --> 00:50:06.401
Douglas, get off the juice.

762
00:50:06.569 --> 00:50:09.481
As for the nocturnal emissions,
why don't you take a swim...

763
00:50:09.649 --> 00:50:13.324
...buy a shirt with no holes,
find a wahine and take her to dinner.

764
00:50:13.489 --> 00:50:15.605
I'll tell my friend you said so.

765
00:50:16.289 --> 00:50:18.928
In any case, Lucy,
your condition is stable...

766
00:50:19.089 --> 00:50:20.602
...but most likely permanent.

767
00:50:21.009 --> 00:50:22.886
I'm so sorry, dear.

768
00:50:23.249 --> 00:50:24.841
But it could be worse.

769
00:50:26.409 --> 00:50:27.728
Yeah? How?

770
00:50:27.889 --> 00:50:30.608
I think you should meet
Ten Second Tom.

771
00:50:30.969 --> 00:50:34.564
Callahan Institute is the leading
brain-injury clinic in the Pacific Rim.

772
00:50:34.729 --> 00:50:37.846
We are funded out of Sandusky, Ohio
by T.B. Callahan...

773
00:50:38.009 --> 00:50:41.160
...the automotive-components tycoon
and philanthropist.

774
00:50:45.889 --> 00:50:48.323
And now, I would like
to introduce to you...

775
00:50:48.489 --> 00:50:51.208
...our most distinguished
clinical subject...

776
00:50:51.369 --> 00:50:52.688
...Tom.

777
00:50:52.849 --> 00:50:54.407
- Hi. I'm Tom.
- Henry.

778
00:50:54.569 --> 00:50:55.718
- Marlin.
- Doug.

779
00:50:55.889 --> 00:50:57.083
- Lucy.
- Hi.

780
00:50:57.249 --> 00:50:59.319
Cool flip-flops.
Where'd you get them?

781
00:50:59.489 --> 00:51:02.401
You like those? It's interesting.
I was on the North Shore...

782
00:51:02.569 --> 00:51:03.718
Hi, I'm Tom.

783
00:51:04.529 --> 00:51:06.406
- Henry.
- Hi.

784
00:51:06.569 --> 00:51:08.480
- Marlin.
- Tom lost part of his brain...

785
00:51:08.649 --> 00:51:11.243
...in a hunting accident.
His memory lasts 10 seconds.

786
00:51:11.409 --> 00:51:13.127
I was in an accident? That's terrible.

787
00:51:13.289 --> 00:51:15.325
Don't worry.
You'll get over it in seconds.

788
00:51:15.489 --> 00:51:18.799
Get over it? I mean, what happened?
Did I get shot in the brain...?

789
00:51:18.969 --> 00:51:21.119
- Hi, I'm Tom.
- Hi, I'm Lucy.

790
00:51:21.289 --> 00:51:22.483
- Hi.
- Doug.

791
00:51:22.649 --> 00:51:23.843
- Hey.
- Marlin.

792
00:51:24.009 --> 00:51:26.443
Hey, Tom, can I tell you a secret?

793
00:51:28.809 --> 00:51:31.721
Don't you think you're a little old
to still have wet dreams?

794
00:51:35.249 --> 00:51:37.968
- They liked that.
- Hi, I'm Tom.

795
00:51:38.129 --> 00:51:40.359
- Yeah, watch yourself, Tom.
- Easy.

796
00:51:53.969 --> 00:51:56.278
- I'm gonna go to sleep.
- All right. Good night.

797
00:51:56.449 --> 00:51:58.917
Good night, you guys.
I'll see you tomorrow.

798
00:52:00.369 --> 00:52:02.837
- And I guess I'll see you too?
- Oh, yeah.

799
00:52:03.409 --> 00:52:05.400
You had a rough day today.
I'm sorry.

800
00:52:05.569 --> 00:52:07.685
I hope you get some rest tonight.

801
00:52:08.089 --> 00:52:09.602
Okay.

802
00:52:09.769 --> 00:52:11.168
Good night.

803
00:52:11.529 --> 00:52:12.723
So how you getting home?

804
00:52:12.889 --> 00:52:14.925
- You gonna take the Likelike or...
- Hey.

805
00:52:17.289 --> 00:52:19.883
Thank you for being
so nice to me today.

806
00:52:20.049 --> 00:52:22.517
- Sure.
- I don't want you to...

807
00:52:22.689 --> 00:52:24.327
...strike out tomorrow.

808
00:52:24.489 --> 00:52:26.286
So maybe you could talk
to me about...

809
00:52:26.929 --> 00:52:28.157
...lilies.

810
00:52:28.529 --> 00:52:29.723
Lilies?

811
00:52:29.889 --> 00:52:31.561
I'm a sucker for lilies.

812
00:52:31.889 --> 00:52:33.447
Thanks for the tip.

813
00:52:33.609 --> 00:52:35.042
Good night.

814
00:52:35.209 --> 00:52:36.483
Good night.

815
00:52:36.849 --> 00:52:39.044
My, oh, my.

816
00:52:39.209 --> 00:52:41.120
- Lover-boy.
- Yes, sir.

817
00:52:41.289 --> 00:52:43.405
You don't have to rush off.
Stick around.

818
00:52:44.009 --> 00:52:46.364
You've earned yourself
a couple beers.

819
00:52:47.409 --> 00:52:49.479
So what'll you do when
you finish the boat?

820
00:52:49.649 --> 00:52:51.401
Actually, I'm going on a trip soon...

821
00:52:51.569 --> 00:52:53.878
...to study undersea
Pacific walrus behaviours.

822
00:52:54.049 --> 00:52:55.323
Sounds kind of fruity.

823
00:52:55.489 --> 00:52:57.639
- Thank you.
- How long is it gonna take?

824
00:52:57.809 --> 00:52:58.958
About a year.

825
00:52:59.129 --> 00:53:00.881
Guess you won't miss days like this.

826
00:53:01.609 --> 00:53:04.203
Well, maybe days like this
don't have to be so bad.

827
00:53:04.369 --> 00:53:06.121
What are you trying to say?

828
00:53:07.169 --> 00:53:08.488
When you guys tell her...

829
00:53:08.649 --> 00:53:11.083
...she's not just finding out
about the accident.

830
00:53:11.249 --> 00:53:14.446
She's finding out that her life
is basically a set-up.

831
00:53:14.609 --> 00:53:16.486
I think that freaks her out the most.

832
00:53:16.649 --> 00:53:17.968
- You're an expert now?
- No.

833
00:53:18.129 --> 00:53:20.484
I'm saying I wish there was
another way besides:

834
00:53:20.649 --> 00:53:24.198
"Sorry we couldn't trick you today.
Here's pictures of your broken head."

835
00:53:24.369 --> 00:53:26.599
- You want a broken head?
- You'll give him one?

836
00:53:26.769 --> 00:53:28.839
No, Daddy, I thought
you was gonna do it.

837
00:53:29.289 --> 00:53:31.928
Nobody's gotta break my head.
I'm gonna split anyways.

838
00:53:32.089 --> 00:53:34.557
Oh, don't go just because
my son is psychotic.

839
00:53:34.729 --> 00:53:37.880
Good night. Sweet dreams.
Keep them dry there, Doug.

840
00:53:38.329 --> 00:53:40.047
Very funny.

841
00:54:00.449 --> 00:54:03.009
- Excuse me. Lucy Whitmore?
- Yes?

842
00:54:03.169 --> 00:54:05.478
I have a delivery for you.

843
00:54:05.969 --> 00:54:08.039
- A delivery for me?
- Yes.

844
00:54:09.889 --> 00:54:12.562
Oh, they're beautiful.

845
00:54:12.849 --> 00:54:15.158
- Who are they from?
- That I can't tell you.

846
00:54:15.329 --> 00:54:18.799
It's a secret admirer.
He also wants you to have this.

847
00:54:19.249 --> 00:54:22.446
- Who's your friend, Lucy?
- Oh, well, I mean, I don't know.

848
00:54:22.609 --> 00:54:24.804
We just met, but look.

849
00:54:25.129 --> 00:54:26.881
I have a secret admirer.

850
00:54:27.049 --> 00:54:29.563
Oh, really? What's this?

851
00:54:29.729 --> 00:54:31.162
It's a videotape.

852
00:54:31.569 --> 00:54:32.968
A videotape of what?

853
00:54:33.129 --> 00:54:35.199
I have no idea.

854
00:54:35.769 --> 00:54:37.487
But I have to find out.

855
00:54:38.329 --> 00:54:39.762
Happy birthday, Daddy.

856
00:54:39.929 --> 00:54:42.841
- Thank you, sweetie.
- That's right. Happy birthday, sir.

857
00:54:43.009 --> 00:54:44.840
- What are you, 200 today?
- That's cute.

858
00:54:45.009 --> 00:54:47.921
- What are you doing?
- I wanted to try something different.

859
00:54:48.089 --> 00:54:50.444
If it doesn't work,
we've only wasted one day.

860
00:55:09.409 --> 00:55:11.081
Martha Stewart faced charges...

861
00:55:13.329 --> 00:55:14.682
Oh, God!

862
00:55:54.089 --> 00:55:55.727
Okay, I think it's on Go Go

863
00:55:55.889 --> 00:55:57.959
Aloha! I'm Henry Roth

864
00:55:58.129 --> 00:56:03.886
We met here at the Hukilau Café
about a year after your accident

865
00:56:04.049 --> 00:56:06.927
I lik e you and you lik e me, most days

866
00:56:07.409 --> 00:56:10.560
Every day is different, but basically
this is what happens, Lucy

867
00:56:10.729 --> 00:56:12.082
Kikik olok o, tak e the camera

868
00:56:12.249 --> 00:56:13.477
- I got it
- Don't drop it

869
00:56:13.649 --> 00:56:15.560
Okay, all right
Here we are, right here

870
00:56:15.729 --> 00:56:17.924
The part of you in this re-enactment

871
00:56:18.089 --> 00:56:20.649
will be played
by my good friend, U la

872
00:56:21.449 --> 00:56:23.883
Aloha Sorry about your brain

873
00:56:24.329 --> 00:56:25.648
I had a accident too

874
00:56:25.809 --> 00:56:28.607
Believe it or not, this my good eye

875
00:56:29.489 --> 00:56:30.683
- We ready?
- Yeah

876
00:56:30.849 --> 00:56:34.398
Hi I lik e that waffle tepee
that you have built

877
00:56:34.569 --> 00:56:38.278
Oh! So nice of you to notice
Please, sit down

878
00:56:38.449 --> 00:56:40.360
I would love to

879
00:56:41.209 --> 00:56:42.801
My name is Henry, by the way

880
00:56:42.969 --> 00:56:44.800
My name is Lucy

881
00:56:44.969 --> 00:56:46.925
Smell my fingers?

882
00:56:48.049 --> 00:56:49.562
Fish Right on

883
00:56:50.249 --> 00:56:53.127
So, Lucy, I work at an aquarium

884
00:56:53.289 --> 00:56:55.723
Aquariums mak e me super horny

885
00:56:55.889 --> 00:56:58.449
That's not funny
Don't rub those

886
00:56:58.609 --> 00:57:00.520
Sorry, Mr Whitmore,
if you're watching

887
00:57:00.689 --> 00:57:02.680
It's very late,
and my friend's unstable

888
00:57:02.849 --> 00:57:05.443
Come on, stop with the licking!
You're making me sick

889
00:57:05.609 --> 00:57:07.088
Lucy, I'm sorry

890
00:57:07.249 --> 00:57:11.561
Anyways, I know you wish I was
making all this stuff up

891
00:57:11.729 --> 00:57:13.799
I wish I was too

892
00:57:14.769 --> 00:57:16.327
But the good news is

893
00:57:16.489 --> 00:57:18.559
so many people out there
care about you:

894
00:57:18.729 --> 00:57:22.244
Your dad and Doug and a couple
of your friends here at the Hukilau

895
00:57:22.409 --> 00:57:24.001
who have a message for you

896
00:57:24.169 --> 00:57:27.923
Lucy, as you know,
your mother and I were best friends

897
00:57:28.969 --> 00:57:32.848
That's why I promised her that
I would always help look after you

898
00:57:34.449 --> 00:57:37.282
Sometimes life isn't very fair

899
00:57:38.529 --> 00:57:40.008
but we still have you

900
00:57:42.289 --> 00:57:46.043
Oh, and if you're wondering about
this guy who's making this tape

901
00:57:46.769 --> 00:57:49.329
he's okay

902
00:57:49.489 --> 00:57:53.004
Hey, Lucy Just so you know,
since you lost your memory

903
00:57:53.169 --> 00:57:55.729
I became governor of Hawaii

904
00:57:56.129 --> 00:57:58.404
No, just kidding I'm too smart

905
00:58:00.689 --> 00:58:04.477
Kualaliku! Get your brother
off the dishwasher!

906
00:58:05.329 --> 00:58:08.207
So whenever you're ready,
we'd all love to talk to you

907
00:58:08.369 --> 00:58:10.246
and answer any questions
you have

908
00:58:10.409 --> 00:58:13.128
and you're the best, Lucy Aloha

909
00:58:27.369 --> 00:58:29.803
How many times
have I watched this?

910
00:58:30.289 --> 00:58:31.688
This is the first time.

911
00:58:36.689 --> 00:58:39.408
Okay, she cried for about an hour.
That's not too bad.

912
00:58:39.569 --> 00:58:43.005
I bet in another hour she'll be ready
to see her friends, have lunch...

913
00:58:43.169 --> 00:58:44.363
...get her life back.

914
00:58:44.529 --> 00:58:46.360
We could do this every day.

915
00:58:49.289 --> 00:58:50.927
We'll leave it up to her.

916
00:58:51.089 --> 00:58:52.522
All right.

917
00:58:55.729 --> 00:58:57.799
So how's the cow?

918
00:58:57.969 --> 00:59:01.086
Same as you. Every day they
have to convince her she's a cow.

919
00:59:05.689 --> 00:59:08.283
Wow, look. The bark is healing.

920
00:59:08.449 --> 00:59:10.440
You're gonna get there.

921
00:59:10.609 --> 00:59:13.169
I never hung out with you
in the afternoon like this.

922
00:59:13.329 --> 00:59:15.684
In this lighting, man, oh, man,
you look...

923
00:59:16.009 --> 00:59:18.045
...disgusting.

924
00:59:18.529 --> 00:59:20.121
Yeah.

925
00:59:20.289 --> 00:59:24.919
I don't know how you get me to fall for
that egg-shaped head every morning.

926
00:59:25.089 --> 00:59:27.887
All I have to do is slide on
my designer jeans...

927
00:59:28.049 --> 00:59:31.439
...and just kind of wiggle
in front of you. You go nuts.

928
00:59:32.849 --> 00:59:36.364
Why couldn't I have met you one day
before the accident?

929
00:59:36.529 --> 00:59:40.044
Don't worry, because if you hung out
with me for more than one day...

930
00:59:40.209 --> 00:59:42.245
...you'd realize I'm a bore.

931
00:59:42.409 --> 00:59:44.525
- Oh, well, I have news for you.
- Yes?

932
00:59:44.689 --> 00:59:46.520
It takes less than one day.

933
00:59:46.689 --> 00:59:48.600
You know something?
That hurt.

934
00:59:48.769 --> 00:59:51.567
Your damaged temporal lobe
is causing me pain...

935
00:59:51.729 --> 00:59:53.481
...and I'm gonna get you for that.

936
00:59:54.769 --> 00:59:56.646
Now you're dead!

937
01:00:14.449 --> 01:00:17.486
- I can't believe you're pregnant.
- I know.

938
01:00:17.649 --> 01:00:20.527
- And I got her on the first try.
- Yeah. Easy.

939
01:00:20.689 --> 01:00:22.441
And, Tammy, you are so thin.

940
01:00:22.609 --> 01:00:23.883
Thanks, Luce.

941
01:00:24.049 --> 01:00:25.767
And I'm so glad you finally got...

942
01:00:25.929 --> 01:00:29.001
...that gender-reassignment surgery,
Jennifer. I mean, Jonathan.

943
01:00:29.409 --> 01:00:31.001
Mahalo.

944
01:00:31.889 --> 01:00:33.322
- Here you go, Lucy.
- Thank you.

945
01:00:33.489 --> 01:00:35.605
- You're welcome.
- You must be Lucy's friend.

946
01:00:35.769 --> 01:00:39.125
- The one who made the tape.
- I think he's more than my friend.

947
01:00:39.289 --> 01:00:41.245
- You're my boyfriend, right?
- Yes, ma'am.

948
01:00:41.409 --> 01:00:44.003
So every day you help her
to realize what happened...

949
01:00:44.169 --> 01:00:46.808
...and you wait patiently for her
to be okay with it...

950
01:00:46.969 --> 01:00:48.960
...then get her to fall in love
with you again?

951
01:00:49.489 --> 01:00:50.683
Yes, ma'am.

952
01:00:52.089 --> 01:00:53.283
You asshole!

953
01:00:53.449 --> 01:00:56.361
You don't even open the fricking car
door for me anymore.

954
01:00:57.009 --> 01:00:58.283
You're in trouble.

955
01:00:59.729 --> 01:01:01.287
I gotta go tinkle.

956
01:01:05.249 --> 01:01:08.605
Okay, so tell me a little bit more
about yourself.

957
01:01:08.769 --> 01:01:10.760
Okay. Well, I've...

958
01:01:10.929 --> 01:01:13.966
...won over seven all-you-can-eat
chicken-wing contests.

959
01:01:14.129 --> 01:01:16.199
- Really?
- Yes.

960
01:01:16.369 --> 01:01:19.247
And I'm a ballet dancer,
but only in my bathroom.

961
01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:21.964
No, what do you want to know?

962
01:01:23.649 --> 01:01:25.162
Do you love me?

963
01:01:28.209 --> 01:01:30.006
I didn't mean to put you on the spot.

964
01:01:30.169 --> 01:01:32.842
I was just asking more for
informational purposes.

965
01:01:33.009 --> 01:01:35.239
It's to keep the video as up-to-date
as possible.

966
01:01:35.409 --> 01:01:37.001
Sure.

967
01:01:38.169 --> 01:01:41.957
Well, love is a very loaded word.

968
01:01:44.369 --> 01:01:46.280
Let's see. I...

969
01:01:46.769 --> 01:01:51.889
I go to this restaurant every morning,
and I see you there, reading.

970
01:01:52.209 --> 01:01:54.006
And...

971
01:01:56.329 --> 01:01:58.763
I love you very much.

972
01:01:59.209 --> 01:02:02.201
Probably more than anybody could
love another person.

973
01:02:05.969 --> 01:02:08.483
And how do I feel about you?

974
01:02:09.169 --> 01:02:11.524
You're excited about
the chicken-wing thing.

975
01:02:12.289 --> 01:02:14.007
And...

976
01:02:14.169 --> 01:02:17.241
...you've been dying to make out
with me for some time now.

977
01:02:28.369 --> 01:02:29.802
Feeling better now?

978
01:02:29.969 --> 01:02:32.688
Nothing beats a first kiss.

979
01:02:39.929 --> 01:02:42.921
There's nothing like a first kiss.

980
01:03:04.529 --> 01:03:06.599
Nothing beats a first kiss.

981
01:03:06.769 --> 01:03:08.839
That's what I've heard.

982
01:03:13.329 --> 01:03:15.365
Nothing beats a first...

983
01:03:26.489 --> 01:03:27.717
What are you doing?

984
01:03:27.889 --> 01:03:30.278
Nothing. I was just getting
some lint off for you.

985
01:03:30.449 --> 01:03:32.326
You were going for a feelski!

986
01:03:32.489 --> 01:03:37.165
All right, I'm sorry, but this is like the
23rd time we've made out already...

987
01:03:37.329 --> 01:03:38.762
...and they're getting blue.

988
01:03:39.369 --> 01:03:41.724
I know. I know.

989
01:03:41.889 --> 01:03:44.687
I mean, I really don't know.

990
01:03:44.849 --> 01:03:47.647
For me, it still feels like the first time.

991
01:03:47.809 --> 01:03:49.447
Okay, let's average it out then.

992
01:03:49.609 --> 01:03:52.407
It's the 23rd time for me
and the first time for you.

993
01:03:52.569 --> 01:03:54.799
- That's about our 12th time.
- Yeah?

994
01:03:54.969 --> 01:03:57.802
Now, Hawaiian law clearly states
after the 12th date...

995
01:03:57.969 --> 01:04:01.086
...l'm entitled to unlimited
boob access.

996
01:04:02.009 --> 01:04:06.127
Why didn't I meet you one day
before the accident?

997
01:04:07.249 --> 01:04:09.479
You say that all the time.

998
01:04:09.649 --> 01:04:11.560
You want to meet a friend of mine?

999
01:04:15.329 --> 01:04:16.842
All right.

1000
01:04:17.929 --> 01:04:21.478
Jocko, this is Lucy.
Lucy, this is Jocko.

1001
01:04:21.929 --> 01:04:25.319
Wow! Thank you. Nice to meet you.

1002
01:04:26.169 --> 01:04:28.603
He is awesome! He is so smart.

1003
01:04:28.769 --> 01:04:32.842
Check this out. Jocko, what does
the teapot do when the water's ready?

1004
01:04:35.889 --> 01:04:37.720
- Very good.
- Can I ask him a question?

1005
01:04:37.889 --> 01:04:39.402
Go ahead.

1006
01:04:39.889 --> 01:04:41.481
Jocko...

1007
01:04:41.649 --> 01:04:45.198
...do you think that Henry and I
are ready to take our relationship...

1008
01:04:45.369 --> 01:04:47.087
...to the next level?

1009
01:04:48.689 --> 01:04:50.407
You sure about that?

1010
01:04:51.089 --> 01:04:53.728
Do you think I should bring him
into the other room...

1011
01:04:53.889 --> 01:04:56.198
...and take advantage of him?

1012
01:05:01.969 --> 01:05:03.687
I saw that hand gesture.

1013
01:05:03.849 --> 01:05:05.726
- And I'm glad you did it.
- Really?

1014
01:05:17.689 --> 01:05:19.566
- Use that.
- Oh, wow. Look!

1015
01:05:19.729 --> 01:05:20.923
- Yeah.
- They're...

1016
01:05:21.089 --> 01:05:23.398
They're nodding in approval, I hope.

1017
01:05:23.569 --> 01:05:25.844
They like you. Let me get them
out of there.

1018
01:05:26.009 --> 01:05:28.967
Mary-Kate, Ashley, get a life.
Thank you. Sorry.

1019
01:05:29.129 --> 01:05:32.201
- Oh, they're very nice, though.
- Yeah, so are you.

1020
01:05:32.369 --> 01:05:34.439
Let me get you down slow.

1021
01:05:34.609 --> 01:05:36.918
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

1022
01:05:58.769 --> 01:06:02.045
All right, I just wrote this,
so go easy on me.

1023
01:06:02.969 --> 01:06:06.439
The Hukilau was the place

1024
01:06:07.569 --> 01:06:09.878
Where I first saw your face

1025
01:06:11.929 --> 01:06:14.443
We lik ed each other right away

1026
01:06:16.209 --> 01:06:20.168
But you didn't remember me
The very next day

1027
01:06:21.169 --> 01:06:25.082
Forgetful Lucy

1028
01:06:25.249 --> 01:06:28.685
Has got a nice caboose-y

1029
01:06:30.049 --> 01:06:34.088
I used to trick you into pulling
Your car over so we could chat

1030
01:06:34.249 --> 01:06:38.447
But my fav ourite time was when you
Beat the shit out of U la with a bat

1031
01:06:38.929 --> 01:06:42.239
And we drove up to see Dr Keats

1032
01:06:42.769 --> 01:06:45.966
And found out why Doug always
Has to change his sheets

1033
01:06:47.969 --> 01:06:51.359
Forgetful Lucy

1034
01:06:51.529 --> 01:06:55.841
Crack ed her head lik e Gary Busey

1035
01:06:56.049 --> 01:06:58.688
But I still love her so

1036
01:07:00.169 --> 01:07:03.286
And I'll never let her go

1037
01:07:04.449 --> 01:07:08.044
Even if while I'm singing this song

1038
01:07:08.809 --> 01:07:11.960
She's wishing I had
Jock o the Walrus' schlong

1039
01:07:13.729 --> 01:07:17.961
Forgetful Lucy

1040
01:07:18.129 --> 01:07:22.008
Her lips are so damn juicy

1041
01:07:22.169 --> 01:07:26.606
How about another first kiss

1042
01:07:36.569 --> 01:07:38.605
Can't fall asleep.

1043
01:07:38.849 --> 01:07:40.726
I'm not sleeping.

1044
01:07:40.889 --> 01:07:43.562
I'm just closing my eyes.

1045
01:07:43.729 --> 01:07:45.879
Well, I'm gonna go downstairs then.

1046
01:07:46.049 --> 01:07:50.088
No, no. I'm just resting.

1047
01:07:52.089 --> 01:07:53.647
Lucy.

1048
01:07:53.809 --> 01:07:55.367
Yeah.

1049
01:07:55.529 --> 01:07:57.440
Will you marry me?

1050
01:08:04.489 --> 01:08:07.720
- Of course.
- Good.

1051
01:08:08.209 --> 01:08:10.723
Don't forget about me.

1052
01:08:11.689 --> 01:08:13.486
Never.

1053
01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:31.088
Good morning.

1054
01:08:37.529 --> 01:08:38.723
Oh, shit!

1055
01:08:38.889 --> 01:08:40.959
- Help! Help!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Lucy.

1056
01:08:41.129 --> 01:08:43.848
Lucy! Lucy! Hey, hey, hey.

1057
01:08:44.009 --> 01:08:46.125
I know this is hard for you
to understand...

1058
01:08:46.289 --> 01:08:48.519
...but we are actually
seeing each other.

1059
01:08:48.689 --> 01:08:50.441
We have been for a while now.

1060
01:08:50.609 --> 01:08:51.803
Oh! Lucy! Lucy! Lucy!

1061
01:08:52.089 --> 01:08:54.159
If I was lying,
how would I know this?

1062
01:08:54.329 --> 01:08:57.366
You're an art teacher and you go
to the Hukilau every Sunday...

1063
01:08:57.529 --> 01:09:00.965
...and you make waffle houses
and you like Casablanca lilies.

1064
01:09:01.129 --> 01:09:04.360
- Stalker!
- No, don't you remember me a little?

1065
01:09:11.329 --> 01:09:13.968
I may not be able to kick your ass,
but my sister can.

1066
01:09:14.129 --> 01:09:15.323
Thanks, buddy.

1067
01:09:15.489 --> 01:09:18.128
Little Sammy Sosa's a bit shook up,
but she'll be okay.

1068
01:09:18.289 --> 01:09:20.041
She's watching the tape as we speak.

1069
01:09:20.209 --> 01:09:22.245
How's my temporal lobe
looking there, doc?

1070
01:09:22.409 --> 01:09:25.640
Don't worry. You're not gonna suffer
any short-term memory loss.

1071
01:09:25.809 --> 01:09:28.642
But was your head shaped like an egg
before she hit you?

1072
01:09:28.809 --> 01:09:32.006
Don't make fun of Henry.
It's not his fault it's shaped like that.

1073
01:09:32.169 --> 01:09:35.400
Note the intense overreaction.
That's the "roids" talking.

1074
01:09:35.729 --> 01:09:39.244
- Doug, once again, off the juice.
- It's not juice.

1075
01:09:39.409 --> 01:09:41.161
It's a protein shake.

1076
01:09:41.489 --> 01:09:45.164
Henry, the boys tell me you're setting
sail for Alaska to study walruses.

1077
01:09:45.329 --> 01:09:48.048
- When does that adventure begin?
- That actually began...

1078
01:09:48.209 --> 01:09:52.043
...ten years ago. That's when I started
planning and building my boat.

1079
01:09:52.209 --> 01:09:56.202
All I know is, out of all mammals,
they have the second-largest penis.

1080
01:09:57.569 --> 01:09:59.082
I have the first.

1081
01:10:00.969 --> 01:10:02.243
That's my joke.

1082
01:10:02.409 --> 01:10:04.127
Did you tell Lucy about this trip?

1083
01:10:04.849 --> 01:10:06.282
Well...

1084
01:10:06.449 --> 01:10:10.124
...actually, there's nothing to tell
because I decided not to go.

1085
01:10:10.289 --> 01:10:12.041
I mean, Lucy needs me here.

1086
01:10:12.209 --> 01:10:15.246
I'm just worried about
going away for a year...

1087
01:10:15.409 --> 01:10:17.639
...and ruining all the progress
she's made.

1088
01:10:17.809 --> 01:10:19.242
I know you think I'm crazy...

1089
01:10:19.409 --> 01:10:21.081
...but I think deep down inside...

1090
01:10:21.249 --> 01:10:24.605
...she's starting to remember me.
- No, Henry.

1091
01:10:24.769 --> 01:10:28.205
That's what you want to believe.
It's what we all want to believe.

1092
01:10:28.689 --> 01:10:30.088
But it's never gonna happen.

1093
01:10:34.409 --> 01:10:36.445
Okay. I gotta go to work.

1094
01:10:36.889 --> 01:10:39.403
Will you tell her I'll be back later
to pick her up?

1095
01:10:39.569 --> 01:10:42.686
See you, guys. Don't tell anyone
your sister beat me up.

1096
01:10:43.329 --> 01:10:46.924
He could go to the moon and back and
Lucy would never even know he left.

1097
01:10:47.089 --> 01:10:50.126
Sometimes I wish my wife
had Goldfield Syndrome.

1098
01:10:50.609 --> 01:10:53.487
That way she wouldn't remember
when I called her mother...

1099
01:10:53.649 --> 01:10:57.767
...a loud, obnoxious drunk with a face
like J. Edgar Hoover's ass.

1100
01:11:00.049 --> 01:11:03.086
All right. There's your medicine,
little fellow.

1101
01:11:03.649 --> 01:11:06.243
Ula! Get back to cleaning the pool!

1102
01:11:06.409 --> 01:11:10.368
If that's one of your special brownies,
don't let any of the dolphins eat that.

1103
01:11:10.529 --> 01:11:13.805
How do you think I get them to
double flip and play with white kids?

1104
01:11:17.409 --> 01:11:18.683
Okay, Willie, that's it.

1105
01:11:18.849 --> 01:11:21.317
This time try to stay clean
for more than a day.

1106
01:11:21.489 --> 01:11:23.605
I made you a nice anchovy sundae.

1107
01:11:23.769 --> 01:11:25.566
Okay, enjoy that.

1108
01:11:25.849 --> 01:11:27.248
Henry?

1109
01:11:28.009 --> 01:11:30.125
- Hey!
- How's your head?

1110
01:11:30.289 --> 01:11:33.326
- Oh, it's fine. Don't worry.
- Good.

1111
01:11:33.489 --> 01:11:35.445
What brings your royal cuteness
out here?

1112
01:11:35.609 --> 01:11:36.962
I needed to see you.

1113
01:11:37.449 --> 01:11:38.882
Okay. What you got there?

1114
01:11:39.489 --> 01:11:42.049
It's my journal. I write in it every night.

1115
01:11:42.209 --> 01:11:44.848
- Oh, you don't like the video?
- No, I love it.

1116
01:11:45.009 --> 01:11:49.207
It's just sometimes when I watch it,
I feel like I'm being told about my life...

1117
01:11:49.369 --> 01:11:51.724
...from someone else.
And when I read this...

1118
01:11:51.889 --> 01:11:54.528
...it's like I'm telling myself.

1119
01:11:54.689 --> 01:11:56.168
When did you start this up?

1120
01:11:56.609 --> 01:11:58.440
Right after you gave me the video.

1121
01:11:58.769 --> 01:12:00.999
- Really?
- I was so nervous to come here...

1122
01:12:01.169 --> 01:12:04.366
...and meet the guy that makes me
fall in love with him every day.

1123
01:12:04.689 --> 01:12:07.647
Well, you probably thought
I couldn't live up to the hype.

1124
01:12:07.809 --> 01:12:11.358
No. I was nervous because...

1125
01:12:13.329 --> 01:12:15.524
Because I came here
to break up with you.

1126
01:12:16.889 --> 01:12:20.768
You had plans and a life...

1127
01:12:20.929 --> 01:12:23.568
...before you met me
and now all you have time for...

1128
01:12:23.729 --> 01:12:25.924
...is to make me fall in love with you.

1129
01:12:26.129 --> 01:12:28.962
That's not all I do.
I gave a penguin a bath today.

1130
01:12:31.889 --> 01:12:33.720
Which I'll have to do again tomorrow.

1131
01:12:33.889 --> 01:12:38.326
I look at my dad and my brother's
lives and I won't do that to you.

1132
01:12:38.489 --> 01:12:42.687
What do you want me to do? Be some
chapter in your scrapbook and go?

1133
01:12:42.849 --> 01:12:44.248
No.

1134
01:12:45.329 --> 01:12:51.484
My plan is to erase you completely,
so it's as if you never existed.

1135
01:12:53.489 --> 01:12:55.525
Why are you doing this?

1136
01:12:56.409 --> 01:13:00.527
Because you have to understand
that there is no future with me.

1137
01:13:00.689 --> 01:13:05.558
Don't you want to have a career
and marriage and children?

1138
01:13:05.729 --> 01:13:07.845
I asked you to marry me. You said yes.

1139
01:13:08.009 --> 01:13:09.761
Kids? Yeah, I'd love to do it.

1140
01:13:10.769 --> 01:13:13.522
But how is that going to work?

1141
01:13:13.689 --> 01:13:17.807
I'm gonna wake up every morning with
an enormous belly and no memory...

1142
01:13:17.969 --> 01:13:19.197
...of how it happened?

1143
01:13:20.689 --> 01:13:23.965
I have to make a new journal
that doesn't have you in it.

1144
01:13:24.129 --> 01:13:25.847
But before I do...

1145
01:13:26.009 --> 01:13:28.648
...I really want you to read
what I wrote about you.

1146
01:13:28.809 --> 01:13:30.606
I will read about it tomorrow...

1147
01:13:30.769 --> 01:13:33.727
...when you forget about all this
breaking up stuff, okay?

1148
01:13:34.249 --> 01:13:37.480
I'm not going to forget it.
I wrote it down. I won't let myself.

1149
01:13:37.649 --> 01:13:40.527
And I'm gonna do it whether
you want me to or not.

1150
01:13:41.009 --> 01:13:43.239
I'll be at my house.

1151
01:13:50.929 --> 01:13:52.999
Okay, type this one in there.

1152
01:13:53.449 --> 01:13:55.121
Saturday, November 25th.

1153
01:13:55.289 --> 01:13:59.885
I drove out to Callahan Institute today
and had a talk with Dr. Keats.

1154
01:14:00.809 --> 01:14:02.527
There's one about me.

1155
01:14:02.689 --> 01:14:06.728
Reminder: He makes funny noises
when I kiss his neck.

1156
01:14:07.649 --> 01:14:09.162
I'm gonna miss that.

1157
01:14:09.329 --> 01:14:11.399
You sure you don't want me
to put that in?

1158
01:14:19.569 --> 01:14:21.639
- We can skip that one.
- No, let me read it.

1159
01:14:21.809 --> 01:14:25.927
We made love tonight! It didn't
last long, but it was incredible.

1160
01:14:28.649 --> 01:14:32.847
It's not all about how long you go. It's...
There was a connection, I thought.

1161
01:14:34.009 --> 01:14:35.681
Actually, let's just rip that out.

1162
01:14:57.529 --> 01:14:59.804
Well, that's that.

1163
01:15:07.329 --> 01:15:09.285
Henry, wait!

1164
01:15:15.089 --> 01:15:17.967
Could I have one last first kiss?

1165
01:16:27.009 --> 01:16:30.399
- I ain't gonna do this, Marlin.
- You have to, Henry.

1166
01:17:02.369 --> 01:17:05.327
I'm gonna miss you, but I gotta
get the hell off this island.

1167
01:17:05.609 --> 01:17:07.088
I'm sorry I can't take you...

1168
01:17:07.249 --> 01:17:11.083
...but you've lived here so long you're
too big of a pansy to defend yourself.

1169
01:17:12.609 --> 01:17:16.158
I don't feel bad for you. I know you
got a thing going on with Candace.

1170
01:17:19.889 --> 01:17:21.322
Candace and Bernice?

1171
01:17:23.489 --> 01:17:25.286
Candace, Bernice and Rose?

1172
01:17:27.409 --> 01:17:30.879
Yeah. I fell for one chick and I'm losing
my mind. Good luck with that.

1173
01:17:31.169 --> 01:17:32.522
Okay, baby.

1174
01:17:32.849 --> 01:17:34.441
I love you.

1175
01:17:34.769 --> 01:17:37.158
Thanks, buddy.
Remember to use a condom.

1176
01:17:37.329 --> 01:17:39.240
Or in your case, a Hefty bag.

1177
01:17:49.409 --> 01:17:50.762
Well...

1178
01:17:51.129 --> 01:17:54.121
Okay, you guys. Thanks for coming
to say goodbye.

1179
01:17:54.449 --> 01:17:56.087
Be careful.

1180
01:17:56.249 --> 01:17:59.082
You make sure your father doesn't
get eaten by a shark.

1181
01:18:05.569 --> 01:18:08.367
Thank you, buddy.
What does that mean again?

1182
01:18:08.649 --> 01:18:10.367
Bring me back a T-shirt.

1183
01:18:10.529 --> 01:18:12.759
Oh, okay. You got it.

1184
01:18:13.329 --> 01:18:15.399
Come here. All right. Love you guys.

1185
01:18:16.289 --> 01:18:19.087
My shirt size is medium husky.

1186
01:18:21.209 --> 01:18:23.404
Hey! Kikikuloa!

1187
01:18:23.569 --> 01:18:26.288
No flippies off the dock!
You could get hurt!

1188
01:18:28.849 --> 01:18:33.479
No! All right. Let the master
show you how to get it done.

1189
01:18:41.449 --> 01:18:44.919
Now you kids go down there
and find my nuts.

1190
01:18:45.329 --> 01:18:47.081
Sure you don't want to take Doug?

1191
01:18:47.249 --> 01:18:50.719
Hey! What the heck
are you guys doing here?

1192
01:18:50.889 --> 01:18:55.246
I spoke to the harbourmaster and he
said you were setting sail today...

1193
01:18:55.409 --> 01:18:57.559
...so we thought we'd wish
you bon voyage.

1194
01:18:57.809 --> 01:19:00.687
This is from Nick and Sue.
They send their best wishes.

1195
01:19:00.849 --> 01:19:04.524
That's very nice.
Spam and Reese's. All right.

1196
01:19:04.689 --> 01:19:06.998
I love Spam and Reese's.
Can I have it?

1197
01:19:07.249 --> 01:19:08.807
I guess.

1198
01:19:09.529 --> 01:19:11.565
- Doug!
- That's all right.

1199
01:19:11.729 --> 01:19:14.607
- I'm sorry.
- So...

1200
01:19:15.569 --> 01:19:16.797
...how's Lucy?

1201
01:19:17.369 --> 01:19:20.008
Actually, she's living at the institute.

1202
01:19:20.849 --> 01:19:24.080
- When did that happen?
- Three weeks ago.

1203
01:19:24.689 --> 01:19:28.284
Said she didn't want to be a burden to
me and Doug anymore. I don't know.

1204
01:19:28.449 --> 01:19:30.804
I couldn't talk her out of it.
You know what?

1205
01:19:30.969 --> 01:19:33.085
She's doing really great up there.

1206
01:19:33.249 --> 01:19:36.207
She's teaching an art class
and she gets to paint every day.

1207
01:19:36.529 --> 01:19:38.281
In fact, she's even singing again.

1208
01:19:38.449 --> 01:19:40.519
Hey, look, I got a little gift
for you too.

1209
01:19:40.689 --> 01:19:44.364
It's just a little something
from one sailor to another one.

1210
01:19:46.369 --> 01:19:48.200
You take care of yourself out there.

1211
01:19:48.369 --> 01:19:50.724
- I will.
- Okay.

1212
01:19:59.089 --> 01:20:00.966
Henry did not tell me about you.

1213
01:20:01.209 --> 01:20:03.723
Your fisherman muscles.

1214
01:20:04.209 --> 01:20:05.403
Can I touch?

1215
01:20:06.009 --> 01:20:07.761
Sure.

1216
01:20:13.009 --> 01:20:14.886
Yes.

1217
01:20:22.289 --> 01:20:23.517
The Beach Boys?

1218
01:20:23.849 --> 01:20:26.602
How nice of him to give me a CD
that will remind me...

1219
01:20:26.769 --> 01:20:30.079
...of all the wonderful times
I shared with his daughter.

1220
01:20:30.249 --> 01:20:32.524
What an asshole!

1221
01:20:50.409 --> 01:20:52.365
Oh, why?

1222
01:20:53.009 --> 01:20:55.239
Why would you do this to me?

1223
01:20:55.409 --> 01:20:57.798
You sick bastard!

1224
01:21:02.129 --> 01:21:03.642
Oh, my God.

1225
01:21:04.369 --> 01:21:06.246
Is he trying to tell me something?

1226
01:21:10.889 --> 01:21:13.198
She only sings on days
she meets you.

1227
01:21:15.009 --> 01:21:16.886
She remembers me?

1228
01:21:17.409 --> 01:21:18.922
Holy shit!

1229
01:21:20.049 --> 01:21:22.688
She remembers me!

1230
01:21:27.769 --> 01:21:29.407
Julia, that looks great.

1231
01:21:29.569 --> 01:21:31.799
Excuse me. What am I doing?

1232
01:21:32.089 --> 01:21:35.240
You're painting a picture.
And you're doing an excellent job.

1233
01:21:35.409 --> 01:21:36.967
Oh.

1234
01:21:38.409 --> 01:21:41.321
Holy crap! I suck.

1235
01:21:49.569 --> 01:21:51.207
Hey, hey, hey.

1236
01:21:51.369 --> 01:21:54.088
- Can we help you, sir?
- Yes. I have an appointment.

1237
01:21:54.249 --> 01:21:56.558
- What's your name?
- My name?

1238
01:21:59.169 --> 01:22:02.241
Dude, he forgot his name.
I feel bad for him.

1239
01:22:02.409 --> 01:22:05.162
Just go on up. And good luck
with that memory problem.

1240
01:22:05.489 --> 01:22:07.400
Yeah. Thank you.

1241
01:22:09.169 --> 01:22:10.443
What?

1242
01:22:10.969 --> 01:22:13.005
Lucy!

1243
01:22:13.529 --> 01:22:15.167
Lucy!

1244
01:22:15.329 --> 01:22:17.797
- Hi, I'm Tom.
- Hey, I met you before. I'm Henry.

1245
01:22:17.969 --> 01:22:20.688
Maybe you can help me.
I'm looking for Lucy Whitmore.

1246
01:22:20.849 --> 01:22:22.282
Any idea where I can find her?

1247
01:22:22.449 --> 01:22:23.643
Hi, I'm Tom.

1248
01:22:23.809 --> 01:22:26.642
Oh. Thanks anyways.

1249
01:22:27.249 --> 01:22:29.001
Lucy!

1250
01:22:29.929 --> 01:22:31.328
Lucy!

1251
01:22:35.249 --> 01:22:36.921
Lucy Whitmore...

1252
01:22:38.129 --> 01:22:39.881
...can I ask you a question?

1253
01:22:42.849 --> 01:22:44.965
Do you have any idea who I am?

1254
01:22:50.769 --> 01:22:53.806
- No.
- No?

1255
01:22:55.289 --> 01:22:57.245
That sucks.

1256
01:22:58.769 --> 01:23:01.647
- What's your name?
- I'm Henry.

1257
01:23:02.129 --> 01:23:03.847
Henry.

1258
01:23:05.129 --> 01:23:07.882
I want to show you something.
Will you come with me?

1259
01:23:08.129 --> 01:23:09.482
Well, yeah.

1260
01:23:11.249 --> 01:23:13.080
Hey. Do you know who that guy is?

1261
01:23:13.249 --> 01:23:15.319
Dude, I don't even know who I am.

1262
01:23:15.489 --> 01:23:17.639
Oh, well, you're Pablo Picasso.

1263
01:23:17.969 --> 01:23:21.484
- Really?
- No. Not really.

1264
01:23:24.649 --> 01:23:27.209
This is my studio.

1265
01:23:45.889 --> 01:23:48.449
I don't know who you are, Henry...

1266
01:23:49.929 --> 01:23:53.683
...but I dream about you
almost every night.

1267
01:23:56.089 --> 01:23:57.568
Why?

1268
01:23:58.169 --> 01:24:02.082
What would you say if I told you
that notebook you read every day...

1269
01:24:02.529 --> 01:24:05.441
...used to have a lot of stuff
about me in it?

1270
01:24:06.649 --> 01:24:09.163
I would say that that
makes a lot of sense.

1271
01:24:09.769 --> 01:24:11.487
You erased me
from your memories...

1272
01:24:11.649 --> 01:24:14.686
...because you thought you were
holding me back from having...

1273
01:24:14.889 --> 01:24:16.527
...a full and happy life.

1274
01:24:17.009 --> 01:24:19.398
But you made a mistake.

1275
01:24:19.569 --> 01:24:23.039
Being with you is the only way
I could have a full and happy life.

1276
01:24:24.129 --> 01:24:26.279
You're the girl of my dreams...

1277
01:24:26.449 --> 01:24:30.078
...and apparently I'm the man of yours.

1278
01:24:34.769 --> 01:24:36.441
Henry.

1279
01:24:36.609 --> 01:24:37.962
It's nice to meet you.

1280
01:24:38.689 --> 01:24:41.567
Lucy, it's nice to meet you too.

1281
01:24:45.769 --> 01:24:47.646
Hi, I'm Tom.

1282
01:24:47.809 --> 01:24:49.879
Henry, Lucy. Nice to meet you, Tom.

1283
01:24:50.049 --> 01:24:53.519
Now why don't you come back in
ten seconds so we can meet again?

1284
01:25:36.969 --> 01:25:40.405
Do you, Honah Lee, tak e this woman
to be your lawfully wedded wife

1285
01:25:40.569 --> 01:25:42.844
to have and to hold
from this day forth

1286
01:25:43.289 --> 01:25:45.325
as long as you both shall live?

1287
01:25:45.489 --> 01:25:47.366
- I do
- Really?

1288
01:25:47.569 --> 01:25:49.639
Even though in, lik e, 10, 15 years

1289
01:25:49.809 --> 01:25:52.403
she could possibly let herself
go and then, lik e

1290
01:25:52.569 --> 01:25:54.844
sex could be, lik e,
nauseating for you?

1291
01:25:55.009 --> 01:25:57.603
What are you, nuts?
Your wife's right over there

1292
01:25:59.569 --> 01:26:01.241

1293
01:26:01.529 --> 01:26:04.282

1294
01:26:09.289 --> 01:26:11.644
