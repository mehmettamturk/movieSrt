1
00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:53.035
So tell me. How was Hawaii?

2
00:00:53.512 --> 00:00:56.572
- It was unbelievable.
- Oh, yeah?

3
00:00:57.016 --> 00:00:59.541
- Well, what happened?
- I met this guy.

4
00:00:59.576 --> 00:01:02.112
It was the best week of my life.

5
00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:05.388
It was just a little
vacation romance.

6
00:01:05.524 --> 00:01:07.389
But he was so sweet.

7
00:01:07.526 --> 00:01:09.858
He took me to all these
cool local places.

8
00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:12.327
We went scuba diving...

9
00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:14.897
- Snorkeling.
- Mountain climbing.

10
00:01:15.517 --> 00:01:17.485
We went cliff diving.

11
00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:21.888
Well, we got a little drunk.

12
00:01:22.491 --> 00:01:24.356
- He gave me...
- A back rub.

13
00:01:24.493 --> 00:01:25.790
We slow danced...

14
00:01:25.995 --> 00:01:27.394
...in the rain.

15
00:01:27.496 --> 00:01:29.589
But it wasn't just about the sex.

16
00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:33.025
He pounded me like a mallard duck.

17
00:01:34.003 --> 00:01:35.937
It ended kind of weird, though.

18
00:01:36.005 --> 00:01:38.269
When I asked for his number,
he said he's...

19
00:01:38.507 --> 00:01:39.769
- Married.
- Gay.

20
00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.671
- Entering the priesthood.
- He doesn't believe in phones.

21
00:01:43.012 --> 00:01:46.413
He just kind of ran away.

22
00:01:46.515 --> 00:01:49.006
You know, it was just
a little fling, but...

23
00:01:49.018 --> 00:01:50.508
I won't forget my week...

24
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.419
...with Henry Roth.

25
00:01:52.521 --> 00:01:55.217
- Henry Roth.
- Harry.

26
00:01:55.524 --> 00:01:57.992
Harry Paratesticles.

27
00:01:58.027 --> 00:02:00.125
- Henry Roth.
- Henry Roth.

28
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.224
- Henry Roth.
- Henry Roth.

29
00:02:02.531 --> 00:02:05.762
Henry Roth, why didn't you tell me
you were a secret agent?

30
00:02:06.035 --> 00:02:10.699
I prefer intelligence operative,
and I couldn't tell you until I knew you.

31
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.008
Well, can I call you when I land?

32
00:02:13.042 --> 00:02:16.773
You can call me, but I'll be in Peru.
I said that a little loud.

33
00:02:16.808 --> 00:02:20.504
Come on, that's a 187, code blue.
We got the wolf sleeping at night.

34
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.384
He's slipping his arm in the drawer
and out comes the cookie jar. All clear.

35
00:02:26.055 --> 00:02:27.317
Got it?

36
00:02:28.057 --> 00:02:30.491
Well, maybe when you
get back from Peru.

37
00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.086
- I don't think that's an option, Lisa.
- Linda.

38
00:02:34.563 --> 00:02:37.930
I know. I changed your name
for your protection.

39
00:02:39.068 --> 00:02:41.901
We have to go our separate ways now.

40
00:02:42.071 --> 00:02:44.562
Well, goodbye.

41
00:02:44.573 --> 00:02:46.404
Got it! Moving out!

42
00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.515
- What the hell is your problem?
- Just keep going, I'll give you $20.

43
00:02:54.583 --> 00:02:58.781
- You got it. How's your balls?
- Killing me. Hit it.

44
00:03:13.102 --> 00:03:15.832
Easy, Honah Lee.

45
00:03:16.605 --> 00:03:19.199
Hey, I'm a person, not a seal.

46
00:03:19.608 --> 00:03:25.103
Well, I am a vet, not a doctor. So just
hold still, or I won't give you a treat.

47
00:03:25.114 --> 00:03:26.979
I know, it's okay.
You see that, kids?

48
00:03:27.116 --> 00:03:30.142
You see what happens
when you play with sharks?

49
00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:34.111
Now, why you gotta spread those lies?
Sharks are like dogs.

50
00:03:34.123 --> 00:03:36.751
They only bite when you
touch their private parts.

51
00:03:38.127 --> 00:03:40.118
That's a good title
for my documentary.

52
00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:44.190
Sharks: They Only Bite When
You Touch Their Private Parts.

53
00:03:44.633 --> 00:03:48.228
Or you could call it,
Sharks: They Tried to Eat My Kidney.

54
00:03:48.263 --> 00:03:51.504
All right, enough already.
You too, Willie.

55
00:03:54.143 --> 00:03:55.701
All of you.

56
00:03:56.145 --> 00:03:57.635
He just cast a spell on us.

57
00:03:59.148 --> 00:04:02.049
All right. Put this on four times
a day for two weeks.

58
00:04:02.151 --> 00:04:05.052
- You can handle that.
- What's wrong with that turtle?

59
00:04:05.154 --> 00:04:07.952
Lung problems because
he smoked too much turtle weed...

60
00:04:08.157 --> 00:04:10.216
...which is bad for you. Right, Ula?

61
00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:13.093
What? I don't smoke weed.

62
00:04:13.662 --> 00:04:18.065
Hey, Honah Lee? How's that hot
wahine nympho from Ohio?

63
00:04:18.167 --> 00:04:20.863
Great. I dropped her off
at the airport this morning.

64
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.636
Come on, I need some details.

65
00:04:22.671 --> 00:04:25.834
You get some booby, some assy,
a pull on your poi-poi? Come on.

66
00:04:26.175 --> 00:04:27.836
Daddy, what's a nympho?

67
00:04:28.677 --> 00:04:32.306
Oh. The nympho
is the state bird of Ohio.

68
00:04:34.683 --> 00:04:36.344
You're the state idiot of Hawaii.

69
00:04:36.685 --> 00:04:39.984
Here you go. Bite the fish,
chew the fish, love the fish. Enjoy.

70
00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:42.987
- You crack me up, kamaaina.
- Oh, yeah?

71
00:04:43.022 --> 00:04:44.090
- One of these days...
- Yeah?

72
00:04:44.693 --> 00:04:47.491
...you'll show one of those
tourists such a good time...

73
00:04:47.696 --> 00:04:49.163
...she'll wanna stay on the island.

74
00:04:49.198 --> 00:04:51.132
Why do you say
mean things like that...

75
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.191
...and why is your foot
on my pillow?

76
00:04:55.204 --> 00:04:58.332
I don't want your ass on it, either.
Get up! Get up!

77
00:04:58.707 --> 00:05:00.174
It could happen.

78
00:05:00.209 --> 00:05:03.076
Then you won't be able to go
on your boat trip to Alaska.

79
00:05:03.712 --> 00:05:10.015
You'll be stuck here, waking up next to
the same old, ugly broad, just like Ula.

80
00:05:12.721 --> 00:05:17.522
- Just kidding, guys.
- About the old part or the ugly part?

81
00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:22.823
Henry, come quickly!
It's Jocko!

82
00:05:29.238 --> 00:05:32.002
Jocko! What's going on
with you, buddy?

83
00:05:32.241 --> 00:05:35.108
Don't be scared.
Everything's gonna be fine.

84
00:05:35.244 --> 00:05:37.610
Just stay calm. All right.

85
00:05:37.746 --> 00:05:41.842
Willie, I don't need you to see this.
Get out of here, now!

86
00:05:42.251 --> 00:05:44.776
Okay, check the temperature
of the pool. Go! Hurry!

87
00:05:47.256 --> 00:05:49.816
What are you doing?
I meant check the thermometer!

88
00:05:49.851 --> 00:05:51.817
Give me a hand. Let's go!

89
00:05:52.261 --> 00:05:54.525
Get me two fish
from the barrel. Now.

90
00:05:54.763 --> 00:05:56.094
- Okay.
- Just hang in there.

91
00:05:56.265 --> 00:05:58.199
- Here.
- It's gonna be all right.

92
00:05:58.267 --> 00:06:01.327
That's a little warm.
Go to the bottom of the barrel, please.

93
00:06:08.277 --> 00:06:10.472
Okay, there. That's good. Thank you.

94
00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:12.246
Come on, buddy, take it. Take it.

95
00:06:12.281 --> 00:06:14.272
- He's not responding!
- I know, Alexa!

96
00:06:14.783 --> 00:06:17.769
Sorry, I smacked you. You needed
the fish-slap to calm down.

97
00:06:17.804 --> 00:06:20.755
- Do you understand? Are you calm?
- Yes. Fish-slap calm me.

98
00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:23.189
I'm gonna try to get him
breathing manually...

99
00:06:23.792 --> 00:06:26.989
...so I need your face next
to his mouth to see if it's working.

100
00:06:27.024 --> 00:06:28.228
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

101
00:06:28.797 --> 00:06:31.163
- One, two, three!
- Nothing, nothing!

102
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.737
All right! Try it again. If it doesn't
work we'll perform a tracheotomy.

103
00:06:35.804 --> 00:06:39.001
We don't wanna do that, so let's
pray this works. One more time.

104
00:06:39.308 --> 00:06:41.333
One, two...

105
00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:52.786
That's a lot of vomit.

106
00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:56.154
This is why I got into
this business.

107
00:06:56.325 --> 00:06:58.418
To save sea animals.

108
00:06:58.827 --> 00:07:00.761
You should go
wash yourself off, okay?

109
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.322
Maybe try some turpentine.
That might take the stink away.

110
00:07:06.335 --> 00:07:08.303
Yeah, high-five is right, buddy.

111
00:07:08.837 --> 00:07:12.637
I knew you were gonna burp,
but the vomit thing was awesome!

112
00:07:12.841 --> 00:07:16.038
That's what she gets for eating
my roast beef sandwich.

113
00:07:16.345 --> 00:07:17.607
Willie, did you see that?

114
00:07:38.367 --> 00:07:41.598
Captain's log:
November 5th, 6: 45 a. m.

115
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:45.169
I've taken the Sea Serpent for
a trip around the island of Oahu.

116
00:07:45.374 --> 00:07:48.275
It is by far the longest voyage
she has yet undertaken...

117
00:07:48.377 --> 00:07:51.039
...and its completion will signal
that she's ready...

118
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.347
...for our great journey
to Bristol Bay...

119
00:07:53.382 --> 00:07:56.874
...whose unspoiled walrus habitat
will yield an abundance of...

120
00:08:04.893 --> 00:08:06.884
Damn it!

121
00:08:07.396 --> 00:08:09.023
Are you kidding me?

122
00:08:28.417 --> 00:08:30.715
Aloha, honey.
What can I get for you?

123
00:08:30.919 --> 00:08:33.410
I guess I'll take a cup of coffee.

124
00:08:33.922 --> 00:08:36.390
- You guess?
- Yeah, I already ate breakfast.

125
00:08:36.425 --> 00:08:40.122
I need to kill some time before the
Coast Guard gets here to tow my boat.

126
00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:41.691
What did you eat?

127
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:45.593
I had a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup
and some Gatorade.

128
00:08:45.934 --> 00:08:48.960
They're not breakfast.
I get you Spam and eggs.

129
00:08:48.995 --> 00:08:51.303
Nick, I need Spam and eggs.

130
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.567
Hey.

131
00:08:53.942 --> 00:08:57.207
- You like the peanut butter cups?
- Yes.

132
00:08:57.446 --> 00:08:59.812
Want me to put peanut butter cups
in your eggs?

133
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:02.280
No, that's okay.

134
00:09:03.452 --> 00:09:05.147
Peanut butter cups.

135
00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:26.270
- Hey, Sue, nice haircut.
- Mahalo, Lucy.

136
00:09:58.507 --> 00:09:59.973
Are you staring at me or her?

137
00:10:00.008 --> 00:10:01.999
Because you're starting
to freak me out.

138
00:10:03.011 --> 00:10:06.412
Settle down and eat your pancakes.

139
00:10:10.519 --> 00:10:13.283
I think she's a local girl.
I wanted to go up to her...

140
00:10:13.522 --> 00:10:16.787
...but I was kind of off my game.
But, man, was she cute, though.

141
00:10:16.822 --> 00:10:19.050
I thought you liked your bitches
from out of state.

142
00:10:19.528 --> 00:10:23.294
Yeah, that's usually my policy.
Make sure I don't get tied down.

143
00:10:23.532 --> 00:10:25.932
Freeze that image right there.

144
00:10:26.535 --> 00:10:30.335
There's the little fella.
Congratulations, Mommy.

145
00:10:30.539 --> 00:10:34.771
Sounds to me like someone
is afraid of commitment.

146
00:10:35.043 --> 00:10:36.510
Let me guess.

147
00:10:36.545 --> 00:10:39.013
Your high school sweetheart
got drunk at party...

148
00:10:39.047 --> 00:10:42.175
...then cheated on you
with whole wrestling team.

149
00:10:42.551 --> 00:10:45.748
Close. Actually, it was my
college girlfriend Tracy.

150
00:10:46.054 --> 00:10:49.022
And it wasn't a wrestling team.
It was her academic advisor.

151
00:10:49.057 --> 00:10:53.084
- Oh, she liked the older man.
- Older women. About 50 years older.

152
00:10:53.119 --> 00:10:55.222
I hope you shot the stupid tramp.

153
00:10:55.564 --> 00:10:57.930
What's with the "tramp"
and the "bitches" talk?

154
00:10:58.066 --> 00:11:01.661
- Are you drunk or something?
- I apologize for nasty talk.

155
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:05.437
I am grouchy due to lack
of recent physical intimacy.

156
00:11:06.074 --> 00:11:09.441
Shut up, because here comes
one-time-only opportunity.

157
00:11:09.578 --> 00:11:13.446
What I will do now is go into
your office and become naked.

158
00:11:15.584 --> 00:11:17.211
Next move is up to you.

159
00:11:18.086 --> 00:11:20.486
I may not be as limber
as I once was...

160
00:11:20.589 --> 00:11:26.084
...but I make up for it with enthusiasm
and willingness to experiment.

161
00:11:27.596 --> 00:11:30.531
I don't know if you realize,
I'm not into guys.

162
00:11:50.118 --> 00:11:52.085
Hey, Mr. Peanut Butter Cups.

163
00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.748
Hey, Mr. Could-Kill-Me-in-One-Punch.
How you doing?

164
00:11:55.123 --> 00:11:57.785
- You're back.
- Couldn't get enough of that Spam.

165
00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.719
Fry some up and throw
some eggs on it.

166
00:12:00.128 --> 00:12:01.686
- You got it.
- All right, mahalo.

167
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:04.428
- Hi, Lucy.
- Hi, Nick.

168
00:12:18.146 --> 00:12:21.115
You know, why don't you try this?

169
00:12:24.152 --> 00:12:26.746
It's kind of a hinge.

170
00:12:29.157 --> 00:12:32.854
- Now, why didn't I think of that?
- Well, you're too close to the project.

171
00:12:33.161 --> 00:12:34.492
Don't be hard on yourself.

172
00:12:34.663 --> 00:12:37.427
Right. Sometimes you need
an outsider's perspective.

173
00:12:37.666 --> 00:12:39.395
Fresh eye never hurts.

174
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:42.932
I'm Lucy.

175
00:12:43.171 --> 00:12:44.604
Yes. I'm Henry Roth.

176
00:12:44.673 --> 00:12:46.504
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

177
00:12:46.675 --> 00:12:49.735
It's pretty. Keep up the good work.

178
00:12:50.679 --> 00:12:54.979
Wait. I see you're sitting there alone.
Do you wanna come and sit down?

179
00:12:55.684 --> 00:12:59.950
- Sure, that'd be great, if that's all right.
- Okay.

180
00:13:03.191 --> 00:13:07.059
- So are you an architect?
- I am not. I'm in fish.

181
00:13:07.195 --> 00:13:09.162
Oh, that's where the smell
is coming from.

182
00:13:09.197 --> 00:13:11.859
Yeah, yeah, I was feeding
a walrus this morning...

183
00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.034
...and I thought I got most of it
off of me, but guess I didn't.

184
00:13:16.705 --> 00:13:19.139
- I love that smell.
- No, you don't.

185
00:13:19.207 --> 00:13:22.540
- Fish don't even like that smell.
- No, I do. My dad's a fisherman.

186
00:13:22.711 --> 00:13:26.647
He and my brother Doug, they go
out to sea for months at a time.

187
00:13:27.215 --> 00:13:30.742
And I miss them so much while they're
gone that when they come back...

188
00:13:30.777 --> 00:13:34.587
...I just hold on to them
for five minutes each.

189
00:13:37.225 --> 00:13:42.492
And they smell just like your hands.
It's the best smell in the world.

190
00:13:43.231 --> 00:13:45.028
Well, my fingers are available...

191
00:13:45.233 --> 00:13:47.963
...for your sniffing pleasure
anytime you need them.

192
00:13:48.737 --> 00:13:50.705
- Wanna?
- Okay.

193
00:13:59.748 --> 00:14:03.650
Sea lions are known
for their athleticism...

194
00:14:03.752 --> 00:14:06.186
...and dolphins are known
for their intelligence.

195
00:14:06.755 --> 00:14:10.724
- Walruses are known for their...
- Tusks?

196
00:14:10.759 --> 00:14:16.698
Their tusks. Also their male parts
can get pretty gigantic.

197
00:14:17.766 --> 00:14:21.429
Yeah, yeah, it's the second biggest
out of all the mammals.

198
00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:25.728
- What's the first?
- I think Tattoo-Face.

199
00:14:29.778 --> 00:14:31.439
I like your laugh.

200
00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.747
I like you making me laugh.

201
00:14:33.782 --> 00:14:36.649
I hate to break this up,
but we're setting up for lunch.

202
00:14:37.285 --> 00:14:39.913
Oh, okay. Sorry, Sue.

203
00:14:40.789 --> 00:14:44.156
And the real cool thing about walruses
is they're very mysterious.

204
00:14:44.292 --> 00:14:46.522
- Mysterious?
- Yeah, yeah.

205
00:14:46.795 --> 00:14:49.262
We don't really know what
they're like in the wild.

206
00:14:49.297 --> 00:14:52.528
Don't they just sleep on icebergs
and yawn all the time?

207
00:14:52.801 --> 00:14:55.668
All we really see is what they do
outside of the water...

208
00:14:55.804 --> 00:14:58.329
...but who knows what
they do under the ice...

209
00:14:58.807 --> 00:15:01.105
...where they spend
two-thirds of their lives.

210
00:15:01.309 --> 00:15:06.008
Well, maybe they're intimidating the
other creatures with their big winkies.

211
00:15:06.043 --> 00:15:07.975
That is one theory.

212
00:15:09.317 --> 00:15:11.649
- I have to go.
- Where you going?

213
00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:15.517
It's my dad's birthday, and we go
every year and we pick a pineapple.

214
00:15:15.824 --> 00:15:19.590
- It's a tradition.
- That sounds nice. Okay, well...

215
00:15:19.828 --> 00:15:21.318
...I had a great time.

216
00:15:21.329 --> 00:15:23.422
- Me too.
- Okay.

217
00:15:24.332 --> 00:15:28.132
Would you like to have breakfast
again tomorrow morning, same time?

218
00:15:28.336 --> 00:15:30.736
- Because I teach an art class at 10.
- Really?

219
00:15:30.839 --> 00:15:32.431
- Yeah.
- I wish I could make it...

220
00:15:32.466 --> 00:15:34.365
...but, yes, I will be there.

221
00:15:36.344 --> 00:15:38.005
- Take care.
- Okay.

222
00:15:38.346 --> 00:15:41.509
- One for the road. It is fishy.
- Got you good.

223
00:15:41.544 --> 00:15:42.748
- Aloha.
- Aloha!

224
00:15:42.851 --> 00:15:44.785
See you tomorrow.

225
00:15:44.853 --> 00:15:47.515
Oh, my God.

226
00:15:48.356 --> 00:15:50.950
Oh, my goodness.

227
00:16:00.368 --> 00:16:02.495
Shit.

228
00:16:03.872 --> 00:16:05.999
I had a bee on me.

229
00:16:06.374 --> 00:16:08.706
- All right.
- He was a big one.

230
00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:15.475
Which means
"look at those two shitheads. "

231
00:16:22.891 --> 00:16:25.689
That was the stupidest-looking
swing I've ever seen.

232
00:16:25.894 --> 00:16:28.226
I'm gonna take a Molokai
on that one.

233
00:16:28.396 --> 00:16:30.864
No throwing. Come on.

234
00:16:31.399 --> 00:16:34.061
Stop laughing, you hyenas.
Let's see what you get.

235
00:16:34.096 --> 00:16:36.234
Okay, you heard me. Go! Go!

236
00:16:36.404 --> 00:16:37.996
Show papa what you got.

237
00:16:48.917 --> 00:16:52.978
- You suck, you're good at everything.
- Father of the Year strikes again.

238
00:16:53.421 --> 00:16:58.552
By the way, cuz, I met this sexy, blond
tax attorney at Starbucks today.

239
00:16:58.587 --> 00:17:02.692
I told her you the kahuna
she wanna have fun on this island.

240
00:17:02.931 --> 00:17:04.694
You want her number?

241
00:17:04.933 --> 00:17:06.662
You pimping tourists for me again?

242
00:17:06.935 --> 00:17:09.597
Yes! I live vicariously
through you, remember?

243
00:17:09.938 --> 00:17:10.904
My life sucks.

244
00:17:10.939 --> 00:17:14.170
Now, come on. Give her the Waikikiki
sneaky between the cheeky.

245
00:17:15.443 --> 00:17:19.880
Ula needs it. I imagine I did it and then
I can get through another weekend.

246
00:17:19.948 --> 00:17:22.212
I'm staying in. Sorry.
Thank you, though.

247
00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:24.179
- What?
- Hey, Dad!

248
00:17:24.452 --> 00:17:26.443
Not now, Keanu Mokokokakau.

249
00:17:26.454 --> 00:17:28.012
But your stitches are bleeding.

250
00:17:30.458 --> 00:17:32.221
It must've been my huge back-swing.

251
00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:35.588
You think you can stitch me up
after I get back from surfing?

252
00:17:35.964 --> 00:17:39.491
- Yeah, looking forward to it.
- I wouldn't surf with a wound like that.

253
00:17:39.526 --> 00:17:40.832
You might attract a shark.

254
00:17:40.969 --> 00:17:43.665
What's wrong with that?
Sharks are naturally peaceful.

255
00:17:43.972 --> 00:17:46.964
Is that right?
How'd you get that nasty cut, anyway?

256
00:17:46.975 --> 00:17:48.442
A shark bit me.

257
00:17:48.977 --> 00:17:50.443
Nice.

258
00:17:50.478 --> 00:17:52.503
Go smoke another one, bro.

259
00:17:52.981 --> 00:17:55.176
That shark theory's
starting to catch on.

260
00:17:55.211 --> 00:17:56.746
Now, will everybody keep it down...

261
00:17:56.985 --> 00:17:59.977
...while I whack the crap
out of this thing?

262
00:18:05.493 --> 00:18:07.586
Sit! Stay! Shit! No!

263
00:18:13.001 --> 00:18:15.526
Where the hell is it?

264
00:18:16.504 --> 00:18:17.971
Looking for something?

265
00:18:24.012 --> 00:18:27.504
Oh, my God!
What are you doing here?

266
00:18:27.515 --> 00:18:30.678
The same thing you are.
Looking for my ball.

267
00:18:31.519 --> 00:18:35.387
This is weird. I've been thinking
about you all morning, all day.

268
00:18:35.523 --> 00:18:37.718
Can't wait to have breakfast
with you again.

269
00:18:38.026 --> 00:18:40.995
I know. And I just wanna eat you up.

270
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:44.465
- Really?
- Yeah. Tomorrow and the next day...

271
00:18:44.532 --> 00:18:47.433
- ... and the next day and the next day.
- All right. Okay.

272
00:18:48.536 --> 00:18:50.003
Oh, my.

273
00:18:50.038 --> 00:18:53.303
Oh, Lucy, that feels so good.

274
00:18:53.541 --> 00:18:57.944
No, my nipples are too sensitive.
Stop that.

275
00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:05.075
- What happened?
- Your ball hooked into that cart...

276
00:19:05.553 --> 00:19:08.920
...bounced back and hit you in
the head. It was freaking hilarious.

277
00:19:09.557 --> 00:19:11.047
- What?
- Who's Lucy?

278
00:19:11.059 --> 00:19:13.823
And what's up with your nipples?

279
00:19:15.563 --> 00:19:19.431
I can't be falling for a local.
I ain't ever going back to that diner.

280
00:19:19.567 --> 00:19:22.331
- This where you got hit?
- Yes!

281
00:19:28.576 --> 00:19:32.034
You're so lucky you're a professional
cliff diver in Hawaii.

282
00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:34.571
- Yeah, well, it's a living.
- I'm a tax attorney.

283
00:19:34.582 --> 00:19:37.278
- We never get to have any fun.
- Is that right?

284
00:19:37.585 --> 00:19:42.921
I'd like to do something
extra fun tonight.

285
00:19:51.599 --> 00:19:54.466
Taking it deep, aren't you?

286
00:19:59.607 --> 00:20:02.058
How about another
fishbowl for the lady?

287
00:20:02.093 --> 00:20:04.510
- Why don't I just tap a keg for her?
- Okay.

288
00:20:05.613 --> 00:20:08.081
I think I'm getting kind of drunk.

289
00:20:08.116 --> 00:20:10.812
- Are you getting drunk?
- Getting there.

290
00:20:11.119 --> 00:20:14.384
So, what are you thinking?

291
00:20:18.626 --> 00:20:20.218
What am I thinking?

292
00:20:23.131 --> 00:20:26.464
Actually, I'm not drunk at all,
Noreen, and neither are you...

293
00:20:26.634 --> 00:20:29.967
...because there's no alcohol
in these drinks.

294
00:20:30.638 --> 00:20:33.129
Sadly, I've used this technique
many times.

295
00:20:33.141 --> 00:20:35.405
It helps lovely tourists,
such as yourself...

296
00:20:35.643 --> 00:20:38.771
...loosen up without impairing
your ability to stay awake...

297
00:20:39.147 --> 00:20:42.173
...and have guilt-free,
vigorous sex with me.

298
00:20:43.151 --> 00:20:44.709
- Wow.
- I'm sorry.

299
00:20:45.153 --> 00:20:48.884
I'm not a cliff diver, either.
I'm afraid of heights.

300
00:20:48.919 --> 00:20:51.648
Well, since it's my last night in town...

301
00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:57.462
...can I pretend you didn't just say that
and still have sex with you anyway?

302
00:20:58.166 --> 00:21:00.794
I can't do it. I'm sorry.

303
00:21:01.169 --> 00:21:04.935
Well, can you at least point me in
the direction of someone who can?

304
00:21:05.673 --> 00:21:08.198
That guy over there
could help you out.

305
00:21:11.179 --> 00:21:13.739
- Isn't that a woman?
- Jeez, I'm not really sure.

306
00:21:16.184 --> 00:21:20.382
But you're too drunk to notice,
remember? Take care.

307
00:21:29.697 --> 00:21:32.188
- Hey, you. Aloha.
- Aloha.

308
00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.398
Not aloha, "hello," aloha, "goodbye. "
We're closed today. Go away.

309
00:21:36.704 --> 00:21:38.934
- What are you talking about?
- Order up!

310
00:21:39.207 --> 00:21:42.039
- Don't move. I have to talk to you.
- Okay.

311
00:21:42.074 --> 00:21:44.872
- Hey! Tattoo-Face!
- Hey, Peanut Butter Cups!

312
00:21:56.724 --> 00:21:58.021
Hi.

313
00:21:58.726 --> 00:21:59.954
Hi.

314
00:22:00.228 --> 00:22:03.527
My fingers are extra fishy today,
if you care to take a whiff.

315
00:22:04.732 --> 00:22:05.994
What was that?

316
00:22:06.234 --> 00:22:09.829
I was petting my walrus all morning
and thinking of you the whole time.

317
00:22:11.239 --> 00:22:14.037
Okay, pervert.
I think that you should leave.

318
00:22:14.242 --> 00:22:17.439
What? I was joking because
of what we talked about yesterday.

319
00:22:17.745 --> 00:22:19.713
Yesterday?

320
00:22:20.748 --> 00:22:22.715
I've never even met you.

321
00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:26.345
- Nick! I need help!
- Coming, Lucy.

322
00:22:26.754 --> 00:22:28.619
Nick, put that down.
I'll handle it.

323
00:22:28.756 --> 00:22:32.055
- You, follow me.
- Wait a... What's going on?

324
00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.455
I was kidding around with you!

325
00:22:35.263 --> 00:22:38.731
What's happening here?
Is she crazy or something?

326
00:22:38.766 --> 00:22:43.635
Lucy is a very special person.
Very different from other people.

327
00:22:44.272 --> 00:22:45.738
Okay.

328
00:22:45.773 --> 00:22:49.766
About a year ago, Lucy was
in a terrible car accident.

329
00:22:50.278 --> 00:22:53.805
She and her father went up
North Shore to get a pineapple.

330
00:23:30.818 --> 00:23:35.482
Her father broke some ribs, but Lucy
suffered a serious head injury.

331
00:23:35.517 --> 00:23:37.917
She lost her short-term memory.

332
00:23:38.826 --> 00:23:40.521
So she can't remember anything?

333
00:23:40.828 --> 00:23:43.490
No, no, no, she has all of her
long-term memory.

334
00:23:43.525 --> 00:23:45.162
That's a different part
of the brain.

335
00:23:45.333 --> 00:23:49.497
Her whole life, up to the night before
the accident, she remembers.

336
00:23:49.837 --> 00:23:52.601
She just can't retain
any new information.

337
00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:57.504
It's like her slate gets wiped clean
every night while she sleeps.

338
00:23:57.845 --> 00:24:01.144
Hold on. This sounds like something
I would tell a psycho girl...

339
00:24:01.179 --> 00:24:03.442
...so she'd stop calling me.
Am I the psycho girl?

340
00:24:03.851 --> 00:24:05.751
I wish I was making this up!

341
00:24:05.853 --> 00:24:08.617
She has no memory
that she ever met you.

342
00:24:08.856 --> 00:24:10.823
What about the
pineapple-picking thing?

343
00:24:10.858 --> 00:24:13.258
She says that every day,
because each morning...

344
00:24:13.861 --> 00:24:17.160
...she wakes up thinking it's
October 13th of last year.

345
00:24:17.365 --> 00:24:20.664
She comes for breakfast because
that's what she did on Sundays...

346
00:24:20.699 --> 00:24:22.598
...and October 13th
was a Sunday.

347
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:26.499
She has no idea
it's more than a year later.

348
00:24:26.874 --> 00:24:28.341
She reads the newspaper.

349
00:24:28.376 --> 00:24:31.311
It's a special paper her father
puts on their porch.

350
00:24:31.379 --> 00:24:34.780
It's from the day of her accident.
He got hundreds of them printed.

351
00:24:35.383 --> 00:24:39.979
Lucy does the same thing every day.

352
00:24:49.947 --> 00:24:51.812
- Hello!
- Back here.

353
00:24:51.949 --> 00:24:55.282
- Hi, Dad!
- Oh, hi, sweetie.

354
00:24:55.453 --> 00:24:57.580
You got one without me.

355
00:24:58.456 --> 00:25:01.914
The lady at the farmers' market
gave it to me as a birthday present.

356
00:25:01.959 --> 00:25:04.587
I didn't wanna hurt her feelings.

357
00:25:06.464 --> 00:25:08.261
I think she likes you.

358
00:25:08.466 --> 00:25:11.924
- Yeah, what's not to like?
- What about our tradition?

359
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:16.497
Well, I have another idea.
I painted my workshop yesterday.

360
00:25:16.974 --> 00:25:18.771
White.

361
00:25:19.477 --> 00:25:21.843
Now it's too white.
Gives me a headache.

362
00:25:21.979 --> 00:25:24.539
Oh, yeah, you definitely
need some color in here.

363
00:25:24.574 --> 00:25:27.474
Well, you know,
that's what I was thinking.

364
00:25:27.985 --> 00:25:29.919
- Really?
- Yeah. Go nuts.

365
00:25:29.987 --> 00:25:33.388
- Paint me something for my birthday.
- I will.

366
00:25:33.991 --> 00:25:37.358
And promise that we can pick
a pineapple for Thanksgiving, okay?

367
00:25:37.495 --> 00:25:40.589
- Sounds great.
- Okay, good.

368
00:25:40.998 --> 00:25:44.331
Hey, you should watch the Vikings
game while I'm painting.

369
00:25:45.002 --> 00:25:46.833
Good idea.

370
00:25:51.008 --> 00:25:54.967
- Yeah, baby. Isolate.
- What are we eating tonight, Doug?

371
00:25:55.513 --> 00:25:58.004
- Spaghetti, Pop.
- Try not to sweat in the sauce.

372
00:25:58.516 --> 00:25:59.949
Sorry, Pop.

373
00:26:07.024 --> 00:26:08.514
Go Vikings.

374
00:26:09.527 --> 00:26:12.826
Seven hundred and five.
Seven hundred and six.

375
00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:15.328
- Seven hundred and seven.
- Hey, you guys.

376
00:26:15.533 --> 00:26:17.626
Hey, sweetie.
How's the painting coming?

377
00:26:17.661 --> 00:26:19.400
- You'll see.
- Cool.

378
00:26:19.537 --> 00:26:22.734
- Oh. What's the score?
- The Vikings are on the two-yard line.

379
00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:26.976
- If they score, they bring it to 14-10.
- Maybe they'll win for your birthday.

380
00:26:28.045 --> 00:26:30.377
And I'll bet Culpepper runs it in.

381
00:26:30.548 --> 00:26:34.814
I'll bet he fakes a handoff to Williams,
throws to Kleinsasser in the end zone.

382
00:26:35.052 --> 00:26:37.782
- Loser does the dishes?
- You're on.

383
00:26:37.817 --> 00:26:39.489
...keep the offense on the field.

384
00:26:40.057 --> 00:26:42.525
Culpepper fakes a handoff
to Williams. He will throw.

385
00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.529
He's got Kleinsasser in the end zone!
Touchdown, Minnesota.

386
00:26:46.063 --> 00:26:47.462
Doug, you're good.

387
00:26:48.566 --> 00:26:50.329
Maybe you should be a coach.

388
00:26:54.572 --> 00:26:56.802
- Dad.
- Moron!

389
00:26:57.074 --> 00:26:58.735
That hurt.

390
00:27:12.089 --> 00:27:13.750
And you don't look a day over 25.

391
00:27:14.091 --> 00:27:17.356
Yeah, right, and Doug's muscles
aren't pharmaceutically enhanced.

392
00:27:17.391 --> 00:27:18.755
What? I use an herb supplement...

393
00:27:19.096 --> 00:27:22.429
...that can be purchased at any
health-food store. Check this out.

394
00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.398
Check out these glutes.
Rock-hard, baby.

395
00:27:25.603 --> 00:27:26.831
Pretty sweet, huh?

396
00:27:27.104 --> 00:27:29.868
Stop it! You're gonna make me
throw up on the cake.

397
00:27:30.107 --> 00:27:31.574
Okay, just open your present.

398
00:27:31.609 --> 00:27:34.476
Okay. Let's see what we've got here.

399
00:27:35.613 --> 00:27:37.342
The Sixth Sense.

400
00:27:38.115 --> 00:27:41.642
Hey! When I'm done doing the dishes,
do you guys wanna watch it?

401
00:27:42.119 --> 00:27:43.518
- Sure.
- Sure.

402
00:27:44.622 --> 00:27:46.817
Ben Friedkin?

403
00:27:47.124 --> 00:27:50.457
Some people, they call me freak.

404
00:27:51.128 --> 00:27:56.532
- Ronald Sumner?
- I am. I am a freak. Look at me.

405
00:27:57.635 --> 00:27:59.000
Just give me a chance...

406
00:28:03.641 --> 00:28:07.202
I can't believe it.
Bruce Willis is a ghost.

407
00:28:07.237 --> 00:28:09.339
I'm shocked.
Did you see that coming?

408
00:28:09.647 --> 00:28:10.613
- No.
- Not a clue.

409
00:28:10.648 --> 00:28:13.811
- Shocked as hell.
- Anyway, it was awesome.

410
00:28:14.151 --> 00:28:16.085
- Happy birthday.
- Love you, Sis.

411
00:28:16.153 --> 00:28:19.953
Your muscles are getting so big, I can
barely wrap my arms around you.

412
00:28:20.157 --> 00:28:21.920
You like that?
Check this out.

413
00:28:26.664 --> 00:28:30.998
Okay, okay! Enough with the titty
dance! Let your sister go to sleep.

414
00:28:31.168 --> 00:28:33.033
- I like it.
- Sweet dreams, Lucy.

415
00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:35.229
- Good night.
- Good night.

416
00:29:25.222 --> 00:29:26.951
Hey, Tracy, how you doing?

417
00:29:27.224 --> 00:29:28.190
Yeah?

418
00:29:28.225 --> 00:29:31.217
Well, things changed a little bit
since high school.

419
00:30:00.758 --> 00:30:03.591
And this is what happens
every single day.

420
00:30:03.761 --> 00:30:06.286
How long it gonna take for
her memory to come back?

421
00:30:06.764 --> 00:30:09.096
Her doctors say it may
never come back.

422
00:30:09.266 --> 00:30:12.394
So, basically,
what you're saying is...

423
00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:15.568
- ... she's perfect for you.
- What do you mean?

424
00:30:15.773 --> 00:30:18.469
You can hang out all day with
no attachment, because...

425
00:30:18.776 --> 00:30:21.711
Her plane leaves every night?
There's a problem with that.

426
00:30:21.779 --> 00:30:23.440
- What is?
- It's evil.

427
00:30:23.475 --> 00:30:24.508
No, it isn't.

428
00:30:24.782 --> 00:30:28.149
You meet her, hang out, flirt,
no commitment, nobody gets hurt.

429
00:30:28.285 --> 00:30:32.244
- She's got brain damage, you psycho.
- Okay, I'll give you that one.

430
00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:34.621
But I think it'd be healthy for you.

431
00:30:34.792 --> 00:30:37.784
You haven't allowed yourself
to connect with a girl.

432
00:30:37.795 --> 00:30:40.286
I appreciate your interest,
but leave me alone.

433
00:30:40.297 --> 00:30:42.788
Hey, you'd be doing exactly
what her father does:

434
00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:45.131
Giving her a wonderful day.

435
00:30:45.302 --> 00:30:49.398
When it's time for you to go on your
big boat trip, poof, you just leave.

436
00:30:49.807 --> 00:30:51.570
She'll never even know you're gone.

437
00:30:51.809 --> 00:30:55.176
I'm not sure about the "poofing" part,
because I'm not a good poofer.

438
00:30:55.312 --> 00:30:56.779
Demonstrate a good poof for me?

439
00:30:56.814 --> 00:30:59.476
Quit busting my coconuts
for five seconds.

440
00:30:59.817 --> 00:31:03.218
All right. Would you stop poofing
on that joint and do some work?

441
00:31:03.821 --> 00:31:07.621
Okay. Let's get this sucker ready.

442
00:31:07.825 --> 00:31:10.726
Then we're gonna take her
out for a spin.

443
00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:16.298
Captain's log: November 7th.
Nearly midnight.

444
00:31:16.333 --> 00:31:19.029
The Sea Serpent is fully
recovered from her mishap...

445
00:31:19.336 --> 00:31:22.396
...and ready to once again
brave the open ocean.

446
00:31:24.842 --> 00:31:27.606
I think my stitches
opened up again, cuz.

447
00:31:27.845 --> 00:31:31.076
You got a cat?
Because I feel something licking me.

448
00:31:42.359 --> 00:31:43.826
How is it?

449
00:31:44.361 --> 00:31:46.556
Peanut Butter Cups.
What are you doing here?

450
00:31:46.591 --> 00:31:48.729
I just wanted to say hi to Lucy.

451
00:31:50.868 --> 00:31:53.166
I promise you I'm not gonna
do anything wrong.

452
00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:54.598
What did Sue say?

453
00:31:54.872 --> 00:31:58.399
She said that if I talk to Lucy,
you'll kill me with a meat cleaver.

454
00:31:58.434 --> 00:32:01.367
She's the boss, cuz.
But don't worry.

455
00:32:01.378 --> 00:32:03.812
Lucy probably didn't wanna
talk to you anyway.

456
00:32:05.883 --> 00:32:07.850
- What does that mean?
- This ain't a disco.

457
00:32:07.885 --> 00:32:10.820
She doesn't want guys hitting on her
during her breakfast.

458
00:32:11.388 --> 00:32:12.855
She does if it's Henry Roth.

459
00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:14.585
- Who that?
- Who that? Me that.

460
00:32:14.892 --> 00:32:18.851
I bet you 20 bucks I can get her
to have breakfast with me again.

461
00:32:21.398 --> 00:32:23.866
- You're on.
- I love it.

462
00:32:24.902 --> 00:32:28.804
- How you doing, honey?
- Hey, Sue. Nice haircut.

463
00:32:28.906 --> 00:32:31.807
Oh, mahalo.
See you in a bit.

464
00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:35.970
Nick and I have an arrangement.
You can trust me.

465
00:32:36.413 --> 00:32:38.313
Don't worry.

466
00:33:00.437 --> 00:33:02.871
You should try this out.
Put it in there.

467
00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:05.101
Swivelly door.

468
00:33:05.442 --> 00:33:07.842
Waffleonians can
come in and out now.

469
00:33:08.946 --> 00:33:12.143
Are you from a country where it's
okay to stick your fingers...

470
00:33:12.178 --> 00:33:13.541
...all over someone else's food?

471
00:33:14.952 --> 00:33:17.182
No, I'm from this country.

472
00:33:17.454 --> 00:33:19.854
Why? Were you gonna eat that? Oh.

473
00:33:19.957 --> 00:33:22.221
All right, well, have a good meal.

474
00:33:27.464 --> 00:33:29.659
- Yeah.
- That was pathetic.

475
00:33:29.967 --> 00:33:32.026
Yeah? Why don't you choke
on your Spam?

476
00:33:32.469 --> 00:33:34.403
Double or nothing tomorrow.

477
00:33:41.979 --> 00:33:44.277
Hey. I'm sorry to bother you...

478
00:33:44.481 --> 00:33:47.348
...but you look like a person
who appreciates fine art...

479
00:33:47.484 --> 00:33:49.213
...so I wanted your opinion.

480
00:33:49.486 --> 00:33:55.948
I drew this. It's a picture of a father
and son fishing off a fishing boat.

481
00:33:55.993 --> 00:33:57.654
There's a walrus right there...

482
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.026
Oh, you don't speak English. Okay.

483
00:34:09.006 --> 00:34:11.531
Doesn't look Chinese.

484
00:34:11.566 --> 00:34:13.635
Forty.

485
00:34:15.512 --> 00:34:16.877
Can I have that?

486
00:34:17.014 --> 00:34:19.847
I need something
to wipe my ass with.

487
00:34:20.017 --> 00:34:21.348
Shut up.

488
00:34:46.543 --> 00:34:48.477
I wonder what's the matter with him.

489
00:34:49.046 --> 00:34:51.571
Looks like a stupid asshole to me.

490
00:34:58.555 --> 00:35:01.149
Excuse me. Okay.
I didn't mean to startle you.

491
00:35:01.184 --> 00:35:03.083
- No, that's all right. I...
- Are you okay?

492
00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:06.358
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm having
a problem with something...

493
00:35:06.563 --> 00:35:08.428
Something that I could help you with?

494
00:35:08.565 --> 00:35:10.362
No, no, no. I just...

495
00:35:10.567 --> 00:35:13.502
...can't read.

496
00:35:14.571 --> 00:35:16.538
You gotta be kidding me.

497
00:35:16.573 --> 00:35:18.598
- I can read that for you.
- No. Thank you.

498
00:35:19.076 --> 00:35:20.839
I can do this on my own.

499
00:35:21.078 --> 00:35:23.045
Appreciate the sentiment.

500
00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.674
I'm gonna get an order of the...

501
00:35:36.593 --> 00:35:37.719
Pan...

502
00:35:38.095 --> 00:35:39.756
Pan...

503
00:35:42.099 --> 00:35:43.412
Panku...

504
00:35:43.447 --> 00:35:44.726
Ca...

505
00:35:45.102 --> 00:35:46.660
Panclocks.

506
00:35:47.104 --> 00:35:49.766
- Pancakes.
- Okay, I'll have pancake.

507
00:35:50.107 --> 00:35:52.473
- Pancakes.
- Pancah... Pancakes! Pancakes!

508
00:35:52.609 --> 00:35:55.208
- I'm so stupid!
- Oh, don't cry.

509
00:35:55.243 --> 00:35:57.808
- Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.
- Don't cry.

510
00:35:58.115 --> 00:36:00.879
- I don't know anything!
- What a loser.

511
00:36:04.621 --> 00:36:06.919
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you sit with me?

512
00:36:07.124 --> 00:36:10.651
You can have some breakfast and
I'll help teach you some of the words.

513
00:36:11.128 --> 00:36:12.925
- Okay.
- All right.

514
00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:15.030
- That sounds nice.
- Come on over.

515
00:36:15.132 --> 00:36:17.157
- Okay, thank you.
- All right.

516
00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:26.473
So I comes before the E?

517
00:36:26.643 --> 00:36:28.941
- Except after C?
- Yes.

518
00:36:29.146 --> 00:36:31.944
Okay, and C is that little
half a squiggly one, right?

519
00:36:32.149 --> 00:36:34.276
- Yes.
- I think I'm getting it.

520
00:36:34.651 --> 00:36:38.143
- How'd you get so good at teaching?
- I'm a teacher. I do it all the time.

521
00:36:38.155 --> 00:36:40.953
I'm an art teacher at
the Haluki-liki Junior High.

522
00:36:41.158 --> 00:36:45.219
Well, you Haluki-liki the kind of
teacher all the kids have crushes on.

523
00:36:45.662 --> 00:36:48.153
I know I would if I was in your class.

524
00:36:51.668 --> 00:36:53.499
Okay.

525
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:56.298
Oh, boy, do my...
My fingers smell like fish.

526
00:36:56.673 --> 00:36:58.504
That doesn't gross you out, does it?

527
00:36:58.675 --> 00:37:00.438
No, not at all.

528
00:37:00.677 --> 00:37:02.508
Really?

529
00:37:05.182 --> 00:37:08.208
If Lucy gets hurt, I'm gonna chop you
with the meat cleaver.

530
00:37:08.243 --> 00:37:09.777
Okay, okay.

531
00:37:11.688 --> 00:37:13.315
So I had a nice time.

532
00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:15.806
- Yeah, me too.
- Thank you very much.

533
00:37:15.841 --> 00:37:17.922
- Let me get it for you.
- Thank you.

534
00:37:18.195 --> 00:37:19.753
Sure.

535
00:37:20.197 --> 00:37:21.994
Okay.

536
00:37:28.705 --> 00:37:33.699
I just want to eat you up, tomorrow
and the next day, next day, next day...

537
00:37:35.212 --> 00:37:37.146
I'll see you around.

538
00:37:37.214 --> 00:37:38.909
Okay.

539
00:37:42.719 --> 00:37:44.152
Really? That's it?

540
00:37:44.721 --> 00:37:47.952
- That's what?
- All that flirting...

541
00:37:48.225 --> 00:37:51.683
...and phony "I can't read" stuff,
and you're not gonna ask me out...

542
00:37:51.728 --> 00:37:53.059
...or for my phone number?

543
00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:55.528
- I can't read.
- Oh, shut up.

544
00:37:55.732 --> 00:37:59.065
That was one of the goofiest things
I've ever seen, but I thought:

545
00:37:59.236 --> 00:38:02.069
"Hey, if this guy is so desperate
to meet me...

546
00:38:02.239 --> 00:38:04.605
...he might be worth talking to. "

547
00:38:04.741 --> 00:38:06.538
But then I get stiffed.

548
00:38:06.743 --> 00:38:08.904
No, no, no,
this is what happened. I...

549
00:38:09.746 --> 00:38:12.078
Mahalo for the ego boost.

550
00:38:12.249 --> 00:38:15.343
- You're right. You're right. I feel like...
- No worries.

551
00:38:15.752 --> 00:38:17.777
I gotta...
I can read a little!

552
00:38:18.255 --> 00:38:21.713
I didn't know I came before E!
That one I didn't know, I swear.

553
00:38:21.758 --> 00:38:23.589
Oh, you idiot.

554
00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.921
I hope you're happy, Shamu.

555
00:38:30.267 --> 00:38:31.791
Marlin. It's Sue.

556
00:38:44.281 --> 00:38:48.445
- Oh, aloha, sir. My name's Henry...
- I know who you are.

557
00:38:50.287 --> 00:38:53.256
- I want to apologize to your daughter.
- Not gonna happen.

558
00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:55.781
She's inside.
We're gonna straighten things out.

559
00:38:55.792 --> 00:38:59.091
Dad, the damn mongoose
got in the garbage again!

560
00:39:01.298 --> 00:39:03.289
- Is this the guy?
- Yeah.

561
00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:06.064
Mr. Roth, I have one simple request:

562
00:39:06.303 --> 00:39:07.930
Stay away from my daughter.

563
00:39:08.305 --> 00:39:11.866
Absolutely. I hurt her feelings
and don't want it to end like that.

564
00:39:11.901 --> 00:39:13.105
It's gonna end like this.

565
00:39:14.311 --> 00:39:15.801
Calm down, little fellow.

566
00:39:16.313 --> 00:39:19.544
I'm gonna kill you! You're a dead man.
Okay, I'm calm.

567
00:39:19.816 --> 00:39:21.408
I'm calm.

568
00:39:21.818 --> 00:39:24.150
- Let me help you up.
- I got it! I got it.

569
00:39:24.321 --> 00:39:28.815
It's just Dad and I work too hard
to protect Lucy to let some idiot ruin it.

570
00:39:28.825 --> 00:39:31.293
I know what you guys do
and I totally respect that.

571
00:39:31.328 --> 00:39:35.059
If you know her condition, you know
she can't have a normal relationship.

572
00:39:35.332 --> 00:39:37.459
The next morning,
she won't know who he is.

573
00:39:37.834 --> 00:39:39.927
And any guy who's okay with that...

574
00:39:39.962 --> 00:39:41.326
...ain't okay with me.

575
00:39:41.838 --> 00:39:45.797
- I'm not looking for a one-night stand.
- Anything with Lucy is, numb-nuts.

576
00:39:45.842 --> 00:39:49.505
Give us a break.
Just stay away from the Hukilau Cafe.

577
00:39:50.347 --> 00:39:52.315
My daughter's been through enough.

578
00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:55.511
Okay. I'm sorry.

579
00:40:00.357 --> 00:40:03.554
I could have whooped his ass,
but this gravel, I slipped on it...

580
00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:06.761
Yeah, well, maybe you need to do
a few more butt flexes.

581
00:40:07.364 --> 00:40:08.831
Cheap shot, Dad.

582
00:40:09.866 --> 00:40:11.333
So fresh and so clean.

583
00:40:11.368 --> 00:40:14.462
Hey, Alexa, did you hook up
with that girl from the bar?

584
00:40:14.871 --> 00:40:16.838
- I chickened out.
- Really?

585
00:40:16.873 --> 00:40:19.865
Yeah, I don't know.
I guess I prefer sausage to taco.

586
00:40:21.378 --> 00:40:24.062
- What?
- Yeah. No, I agree, buddy.

587
00:40:24.097 --> 00:40:26.747
Get out of here.
Run for the hills.

588
00:40:27.884 --> 00:40:29.681
Let me ask you something, Alexa.

589
00:40:29.886 --> 00:40:32.878
If you promised a girl's dad
that you wouldn't see her...

590
00:40:32.889 --> 00:40:35.187
...would you consider that
a binding promise?

591
00:40:35.392 --> 00:40:36.858
- Absolutely.
- Yeah?

592
00:40:36.893 --> 00:40:39.589
Then again, there are always ways
around such things.

593
00:40:39.896 --> 00:40:41.659
- Like?
- For example...

594
00:40:41.898 --> 00:40:46.164
...if I promised a woman's father
I would not see her...

595
00:40:46.403 --> 00:40:50.271
...I would simply shut my eyes
while she serviced my manhood.

596
00:40:52.409 --> 00:40:54.502
That's actually a cool way to look at it.

597
00:40:54.537 --> 00:40:56.208
And a very gross way.

598
00:41:12.429 --> 00:41:15.364
He asked me not to go to the Hukilau.
I'm not going there.

599
00:41:15.932 --> 00:41:17.490
I'm not doing anything wrong.

600
00:41:24.441 --> 00:41:26.636
Sorry to bother you.
I'm kind of stuck here.

601
00:41:27.944 --> 00:41:30.913
- Car trouble?
- Yeah. You mind giving me a jump?

602
00:41:31.448 --> 00:41:32.881
Okay.

603
00:41:32.949 --> 00:41:34.610
Appreciate your time.

604
00:41:34.951 --> 00:41:36.646
Not everybody would have stopped.

605
00:41:36.953 --> 00:41:38.978
- You're real sweet.
- Oh, yeah. Thank you.

606
00:41:44.961 --> 00:41:47.452
I can't believe you fell for that.

607
00:41:48.465 --> 00:41:51.559
Well, my grandfather died
trying to jump-start a car.

608
00:41:55.972 --> 00:41:58.964
I'm sorry.
I was just joking around.

609
00:41:58.975 --> 00:42:02.376
I can't believe you fell for that!

610
00:42:02.479 --> 00:42:04.174
Oh, my God.

611
00:42:04.481 --> 00:42:05.947
That was very good.

612
00:42:05.982 --> 00:42:08.143
- My name's Henry.
- I'm Lucy.

613
00:42:08.485 --> 00:42:10.612
Nice to meet you.
You look like a nice...

614
00:42:16.493 --> 00:42:19.826
Hi. Sorry for the delay.
Should be a few minutes.

615
00:42:19.996 --> 00:42:22.464
- No problem. No worries.
- Where you coming from?

616
00:42:22.999 --> 00:42:24.626
Breakfast?

617
00:42:25.001 --> 00:42:26.434
- Yeah.
- How was it?

618
00:42:26.503 --> 00:42:28.300
I had waffles. They were delicious.

619
00:42:28.505 --> 00:42:30.871
I like making little houses
out of waffles.

620
00:42:32.509 --> 00:42:35.342
- You do?
- That's my thing.

621
00:42:37.514 --> 00:42:38.879
- What's your name?
- Lucy.

622
00:42:39.015 --> 00:42:40.346
Hi, I'm Henry.

623
00:42:40.517 --> 00:42:43.509
Okay, pal. When she stops,
just let her pet you. Look cute.

624
00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:47.183
Go to the middle of the road.
Thank you. Right there. Perfect.

625
00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:56.397
- Oh, shit.
- Here she comes. Smile.

626
00:42:59.536 --> 00:43:01.060
Where is she?

627
00:43:04.541 --> 00:43:06.406
Oh, my God. Oh, no!

628
00:43:08.545 --> 00:43:10.410
Okay. That didn't work.

629
00:43:10.547 --> 00:43:13.414
Shit your pants? So did I.

630
00:43:19.055 --> 00:43:21.023
Okay, this is her.
Start beating me up.

631
00:43:21.057 --> 00:43:22.718
Make it look good.

632
00:43:26.062 --> 00:43:27.689
Give me your wallet!

633
00:43:28.064 --> 00:43:31.158
Okay, haole, what do you think?
You can come to this island...

634
00:43:31.568 --> 00:43:34.469
- ... eat our pineapple...
- Help me! Not so hard.

635
00:43:34.571 --> 00:43:36.704
- Take it easy.
- Try to bang our women.

636
00:43:36.739 --> 00:43:38.837
Making my sister
clean your hotel room.

637
00:43:39.075 --> 00:43:41.373
Okay. What's that have to do
with this? Relax.

638
00:43:41.578 --> 00:43:44.069
- Hey! Hey! Help me, please!
- Stupid haole!

639
00:43:45.081 --> 00:43:48.278
Yeah, that's right. Take that!
And that! And that!

640
00:43:48.585 --> 00:43:50.052
And that! And that!

641
00:43:50.086 --> 00:43:52.350
You got him. You got him.
Enough. Enough.

642
00:43:52.589 --> 00:43:53.886
- Are you okay?
- Yes, yes...

643
00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:55.580
Okay, I'll be back.
Come here!

644
00:43:56.092 --> 00:43:57.719
No, no! I think he's had enough.

645
00:43:58.595 --> 00:44:00.153
I'm sorry.

646
00:44:01.097 --> 00:44:03.327
My eye!

647
00:44:04.601 --> 00:44:06.831
- You got him!
- Not good enough!

648
00:44:07.103 --> 00:44:08.069
Oh, Kamehameha!

649
00:44:08.104 --> 00:44:10.163
He learned his lesson!

650
00:44:10.607 --> 00:44:12.666
- What's your name?
- My name's Henry.

651
00:44:13.109 --> 00:44:14.940
- You did good.
- Hi. Sorry.

652
00:44:15.111 --> 00:44:16.840
I'm in a community-watch program...

653
00:44:17.113 --> 00:44:18.995
Oh, you crazy bitch!

654
00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:20.878
Yeah, keep running!

655
00:44:21.117 --> 00:44:23.517
Okay, okay, he's... He's gone now.

656
00:44:30.126 --> 00:44:31.957
Not her. False alarm.

657
00:44:36.132 --> 00:44:39.226
Don't worry, I called the cops already.
I'm all set.

658
00:44:39.261 --> 00:44:41.729
Yeah? You all set for this, Mr. Smarty?

659
00:44:44.641 --> 00:44:46.575
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

660
00:44:46.643 --> 00:44:50.170
When you're finished playing your
kidnap-victim crap on my daughter...

661
00:44:50.205 --> 00:44:51.374
...come by the house.

662
00:44:51.648 --> 00:44:53.741
Okay.

663
00:45:01.658 --> 00:45:03.182
Oh, boy.

664
00:45:10.667 --> 00:45:12.430
There's something I wanna show you.

665
00:45:22.679 --> 00:45:25.773
We figured it out. She only sings
on days she meets you.

666
00:45:26.182 --> 00:45:28.150
You're kidding me. That song?

667
00:45:28.184 --> 00:45:29.617
That's Mom and Dad's song.

668
00:45:29.686 --> 00:45:32.712
When her mom was alive,
Lucy would have me take that tape...

669
00:45:33.189 --> 00:45:35.606
- ... on every fishing trip I went on.
- Oh, yeah?

670
00:45:35.641 --> 00:45:38.024
Yeah, she knew it would make me
miss her mom...

671
00:45:38.194 --> 00:45:39.957
...and want to come home sooner.

672
00:45:40.196 --> 00:45:44.360
I'm seeing a new side to you, sir.
I gotta tell you, it's grossing me out.

673
00:45:46.202 --> 00:45:47.533
Let me ask you something.

674
00:45:47.704 --> 00:45:50.935
What's in it for you?
What do you get out of this?

675
00:45:52.709 --> 00:45:54.040
I don't know.

676
00:45:59.215 --> 00:46:01.740
Wouldn't you want to spend
an hour a day with that?

677
00:46:01.775 --> 00:46:04.551
Actually, no. She sings like shit.

678
00:46:05.221 --> 00:46:07.689
- What?
- Can I ask you guys something?

679
00:46:07.724 --> 00:46:10.557
What'll happen down the line?
Someday she'll wake up...

680
00:46:10.727 --> 00:46:13.924
...look in the mirror and notice
she aged 10 years overnight.

681
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:16.197
You know something, Henry?

682
00:46:16.232 --> 00:46:19.030
I worry about that
every damn day of my life.

683
00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:25.730
Pardon me.

684
00:46:25.742 --> 00:46:28.836
Sorry to interrupt, but I noticed we
were both eating alone...

685
00:46:29.245 --> 00:46:32.703
...and I thought I could sit with you,
maybe build a syrup Jacuzzi...

686
00:46:32.749 --> 00:46:35.980
- ... for your waffle house?
- Oh, that would be nice...

687
00:46:36.252 --> 00:46:38.550
...but I have a boyfriend.

688
00:46:38.755 --> 00:46:40.780
So I'm sorry.

689
00:46:42.759 --> 00:46:45.125
You're making up a boyfriend
to get rid of me?

690
00:46:45.261 --> 00:46:46.660
No, I'm not.

691
00:46:46.763 --> 00:46:48.856
What's his name, then?

692
00:46:48.891 --> 00:46:50.027
Ringo.

693
00:46:50.767 --> 00:46:52.325
Is his last name Starr?

694
00:46:52.769 --> 00:46:55.761
- No. McCartney.
- McCartney, okay.

695
00:46:56.272 --> 00:46:58.103
- Oh, no.
- All right. I'm sorry.

696
00:46:58.274 --> 00:47:00.674
No! This cop is writing me a ticket!

697
00:47:01.277 --> 00:47:03.268
Oh, whoa, whoa.
I wouldn't go out there.

698
00:47:03.279 --> 00:47:04.678
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Go on!

699
00:47:04.781 --> 00:47:06.146
I'm coming.

700
00:47:06.282 --> 00:47:08.273
The tags don't expire
for seven months.

701
00:47:08.284 --> 00:47:11.082
- They expired May of this year.
- No! No, no!

702
00:47:11.287 --> 00:47:12.754
They expire May of next year.

703
00:47:13.289 --> 00:47:15.280
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

704
00:47:15.291 --> 00:47:17.020
- I don't.
- This is ridiculous.

705
00:47:17.293 --> 00:47:19.523
I'm not paying for this!
It's October!

706
00:47:19.796 --> 00:47:22.264
Excuse me. Can I borrow this?
Look, October!

707
00:47:22.298 --> 00:47:24.163
Lucy, let's go back inside.

708
00:47:25.301 --> 00:47:27.030
What?

709
00:47:36.813 --> 00:47:38.303
What?

710
00:47:44.821 --> 00:47:46.948
Having a bad day, Doug!

711
00:48:28.364 --> 00:48:30.127
Sweetheart...

712
00:48:30.867 --> 00:48:32.630
...these are from the accident.

713
00:48:49.886 --> 00:48:52.616
Oh, no!

714
00:48:59.896 --> 00:49:02.296
I can feel it.

715
00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:07.927
You were in the hospital
for three months, sweetheart.

716
00:49:20.917 --> 00:49:25.115
I have to talk to this doctor.
I need to hear it from him.

717
00:49:25.421 --> 00:49:27.412
You have heard it, sweetie.
Many times.

718
00:49:29.425 --> 00:49:30.824
I have?

719
00:49:32.428 --> 00:49:33.986
I'll take her.

720
00:49:35.431 --> 00:49:38.093
I have to hear for myself too.

721
00:49:48.945 --> 00:49:51.140
Doug, just take this, okay?
I can't...

722
00:49:51.175 --> 00:49:53.609
I can't look at it anymore.

723
00:49:54.450 --> 00:49:58.079
- It's gonna be all right, Luce.
- Don't call me Luce. I barely know you.

724
00:49:58.454 --> 00:50:00.684
Sweetie, you're sort of dating him.

725
00:50:01.958 --> 00:50:04.324
Sorry I'm not better-looking.

726
00:50:06.462 --> 00:50:09.090
What else happened
since last October?

727
00:50:09.465 --> 00:50:13.265
- What about my students?
- Miss Campbell took over your class.

728
00:50:15.972 --> 00:50:18.907
- Did Alicia marry that guy?
- Yeah.

729
00:50:18.975 --> 00:50:21.341
Doug, did you win
the Mr. Hawaii contest?

730
00:50:21.477 --> 00:50:23.775
I didn't know there was gonna be
a urine test.

731
00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:25.708
Wow.

732
00:50:26.983 --> 00:50:28.348
Do we have sex?

733
00:50:29.986 --> 00:50:33.854
No, we don't.
Just so everybody knows that.

734
00:50:34.991 --> 00:50:36.219
We want to.

735
00:50:37.493 --> 00:50:39.188
Just kidding.

736
00:50:42.999 --> 00:50:46.696
So you guys have to just lie
to me every day.

737
00:51:00.516 --> 00:51:02.643
Hey, Lucy.
Good to see you again.

738
00:51:05.521 --> 00:51:07.614
What the hell's her problem?

739
00:51:08.024 --> 00:51:10.549
She doesn't remember
who you are, brah.

740
00:51:10.584 --> 00:51:12.391
Oh, yeah.

741
00:51:12.528 --> 00:51:15.292
I suck at this job.

742
00:51:17.033 --> 00:51:18.967
Lucy, these are your
brain scans here.

743
00:51:19.035 --> 00:51:21.281
I'm afraid they show
no improvement.

744
00:51:21.316 --> 00:51:23.528
The temporal lobe
was severely damaged.

745
00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:27.008
What we believe is scar tissue
here is impairing your ability...

746
00:51:27.043 --> 00:51:30.706
...to convert short-term memory into
long-term memory while you sleep.

747
00:51:31.047 --> 00:51:33.811
The condition's come to be known
as Goldfield Syndrome.

748
00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:37.247
- Who's Goldfield?
- A brilliant Lithuanian psychiatrist.

749
00:51:37.553 --> 00:51:39.520
He himself suffered
temporal-lobe damage.

750
00:51:39.555 --> 00:51:41.648
Took him four years
to publish his findings...

751
00:51:42.058 --> 00:51:44.720
...because he had to keep
starting over from scratch.

752
00:51:45.061 --> 00:51:48.428
Obviously, your sense of humor
is still intact, and that's here.

753
00:51:48.564 --> 00:51:50.327
Magnificent amygdala as well.

754
00:51:50.566 --> 00:51:53.467
- Doctor, I have a question.
- I'd be happy to answer it...

755
00:51:53.569 --> 00:51:57.972
...but as I've told you before, this is a
hygienic facility. Shirts are required.

756
00:51:58.074 --> 00:51:59.507
- Oh, okay.
- Nice move.

757
00:52:01.577 --> 00:52:03.272
Listen, doctor, this...

758
00:52:03.579 --> 00:52:07.208
...friend of mine's been experimenting
a little with steroids.

759
00:52:07.243 --> 00:52:08.948
He's been having a lot
of wet dreams.

760
00:52:09.585 --> 00:52:11.610
Could there be a connection
between them?

761
00:52:11.645 --> 00:52:13.418
Douglas, get off the juice.

762
00:52:13.589 --> 00:52:16.615
As for the nocturnal emissions,
why don't you take a swim...

763
00:52:17.093 --> 00:52:20.961
...buy a shirt with no holes,
find a wahine and take her to dinner.

764
00:52:21.097 --> 00:52:23.292
I'll tell my friend you said so.

765
00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:26.830
In any case, Lucy,
your condition is stable...

766
00:52:27.103 --> 00:52:28.695
...but most likely permanent.

767
00:52:29.105 --> 00:52:31.039
I'm so sorry, dear.

768
00:52:31.107 --> 00:52:32.802
But it could be worse.

769
00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:35.975
Yeah? How?

770
00:52:36.112 --> 00:52:38.945
I think you should meet
Ten Second Tom.

771
00:52:39.031 --> 00:52:42.762
Callahan Institute is the leading
brain-injury clinic in the Pacific Rim.

772
00:52:43.119 --> 00:52:46.384
We are funded out of Sandusky, Ohio
by T.B. Callahan...

773
00:52:46.622 --> 00:52:49.887
...the automotive-components tycoon
and philanthropist.

774
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:57.155
And now, I would like
to introduce to you...

775
00:52:57.633 --> 00:53:00.466
...our most distinguished
clinical subject...

776
00:53:00.636 --> 00:53:02.035
...Tom.

777
00:53:02.138 --> 00:53:03.730
- Hi. I'm Tom.
- Henry.

778
00:53:03.765 --> 00:53:04.867
- Marlin.
- Doug.

779
00:53:05.141 --> 00:53:06.369
- Lucy.
- Hi.

780
00:53:06.642 --> 00:53:08.803
Cool flip-flops.
Where'd you get them?

781
00:53:09.145 --> 00:53:12.171
You like those? It's interesting.
I was on the North Shore...

782
00:53:12.206 --> 00:53:13.376
Hi, I'm Tom.

783
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:16.118
- Henry.
- Hi.

784
00:53:16.152 --> 00:53:18.143
- Marlin.
- Tom lost part of his brain...

785
00:53:18.654 --> 00:53:21.350
...in a hunting accident.
His memory lasts 10 seconds.

786
00:53:21.657 --> 00:53:23.124
I was in an accident? That's terrible.

787
00:53:23.159 --> 00:53:25.286
Don't worry.
You'll get over it in seconds.

788
00:53:25.661 --> 00:53:29.119
Get over it? I mean, what happened?
Did I get shot in the brain...?

789
00:53:29.165 --> 00:53:31.395
- Hi, I'm Tom.
- Hi, I'm Lucy.

790
00:53:31.667 --> 00:53:32.929
- Hi.
- Doug.

791
00:53:33.169 --> 00:53:34.397
- Hey.
- Marlin.

792
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:37.195
Hey, Tom, can I tell you a secret?

793
00:53:39.675 --> 00:53:42.735
Don't you think you're a little old
to still have wet dreams?

794
00:53:46.182 --> 00:53:49.015
- They liked that.
- Hi, I'm Tom.

795
00:53:49.185 --> 00:53:51.517
- Yeah, watch yourself, Tom.
- Easy.

796
00:54:05.701 --> 00:54:08.101
- I'm gonna go to sleep.
- All right. Good night.

797
00:54:08.204 --> 00:54:10.798
Good night, you guys.
I'll see you tomorrow.

798
00:54:12.708 --> 00:54:15.302
- And I guess I'll see you too?
- Oh, yeah.

799
00:54:15.711 --> 00:54:17.770
You had a rough day today.
I'm sorry.

800
00:54:17.805 --> 00:54:19.908
I hope you get some rest tonight.

801
00:54:20.716 --> 00:54:22.183
Okay.

802
00:54:22.218 --> 00:54:23.685
Good night.

803
00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:25.482
So how you getting home?

804
00:54:25.721 --> 00:54:27.814
- You gonna take the Likelike or...
- Hey.

805
00:54:30.226 --> 00:54:32.956
Thank you for being
so nice to me today.

806
00:54:33.229 --> 00:54:35.789
- Sure.
- I don't want you to...

807
00:54:35.824 --> 00:54:37.426
...strike out tomorrow.

808
00:54:37.733 --> 00:54:39.598
So maybe you could talk
to me about...

809
00:54:40.236 --> 00:54:41.498
...lilies.

810
00:54:41.737 --> 00:54:42.965
Lilies?

811
00:54:43.239 --> 00:54:44.968
I'm a sucker for lilies.

812
00:54:45.241 --> 00:54:46.868
Thanks for the tip.

813
00:54:47.243 --> 00:54:50.075
Good night.

814
00:54:50.746 --> 00:54:52.713
My, oh, my.

815
00:54:52.748 --> 00:54:54.739
- Lover-boy.
- Yes, sir.

816
00:54:55.251 --> 00:54:57.446
You don't have to rush off.
Stick around.

817
00:54:57.753 --> 00:55:00.221
You've earned yourself
a couple beers.

818
00:55:01.757 --> 00:55:03.884
So what'll you do when
you finish the boat?

819
00:55:03.919 --> 00:55:05.624
Actually, I'm going on a trip soon...

820
00:55:05.761 --> 00:55:08.161
...to study undersea
Pacific walrus behaviors.

821
00:55:08.264 --> 00:55:09.595
Sounds kind of fruity.

822
00:55:09.765 --> 00:55:11.995
- Thank you.
- How long is it gonna take?

823
00:55:12.268 --> 00:55:13.496
About a year.

824
00:55:13.769 --> 00:55:15.600
Guess you won't miss days like this.

825
00:55:16.272 --> 00:55:18.968
Well, maybe days like this
don't have to be so bad.

826
00:55:19.275 --> 00:55:21.106
What are you trying to say?

827
00:55:22.278 --> 00:55:23.643
When you guys tell her...

828
00:55:23.779 --> 00:55:26.697
...she's not just finding out
about the accident.

829
00:55:26.732 --> 00:55:29.615
She's finding out that her life
is basically a setup.

830
00:55:29.785 --> 00:55:31.753
I think that freaks her out the most.

831
00:55:31.787 --> 00:55:33.186
- You're an expert now?
- No.

832
00:55:33.789 --> 00:55:36.223
I'm saying I wish there was
another way besides:

833
00:55:36.292 --> 00:55:39.989
"Sorry we couldn't trick you today.
Here's pictures of your broken head. "

834
00:55:40.296 --> 00:55:42.662
- You want a broken head?
- You'll give him one?

835
00:55:42.798 --> 00:55:44.959
No, Daddy, I thought
you was gonna do it.

836
00:55:45.301 --> 00:55:48.065
Nobody's gotta break my head.
I'm gonna split anyways.

837
00:55:48.304 --> 00:55:50.771
Oh, don't go just because
my son is psychotic.

838
00:55:50.806 --> 00:55:54.105
Good night. Sweet dreams.
Keep them dry there, Doug.

839
00:55:54.810 --> 00:55:56.607
Very funny.

840
00:56:17.833 --> 00:56:20.495
- Excuse me. Lucy Whitmore?
- Yes?

841
00:56:20.530 --> 00:56:22.736
I have a delivery for you.

842
00:56:23.339 --> 00:56:25.500
- A delivery for me?
- Yes.

843
00:56:27.343 --> 00:56:30.141
Oh, they're beautiful.

844
00:56:30.846 --> 00:56:33.246
- Who are they from?
- That I can't tell you.

845
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:36.978
It's a secret admirer.
He also wants you to have this.

846
00:56:37.353 --> 00:56:40.686
- Who's your friend, Lucy?
- Oh, well, I mean, I don't know.

847
00:56:40.856 --> 00:56:43.154
We just met, but look.

848
00:56:43.359 --> 00:56:45.190
I have a secret admirer.

849
00:56:45.361 --> 00:56:47.989
Oh, really? What's this?

850
00:56:48.364 --> 00:56:49.854
It's a videotape.

851
00:56:50.366 --> 00:56:51.833
A videotape of what?

852
00:56:51.867 --> 00:56:54.028
I have no idea.

853
00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:56.167
But I have to find out.

854
00:56:57.373 --> 00:56:58.863
Happy birthday, Daddy.

855
00:56:58.874 --> 00:57:01.900
- Thank you, sweetie.
- That's right. Happy birthday, sir.

856
00:57:01.935 --> 00:57:03.811
- What are you, 200 today?
- That's cute.

857
00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:07.406
- What are you doing?
- I wanted to try something different.

858
00:57:07.441 --> 00:57:09.817
If it doesn't work,
we've only wasted one day.

859
00:57:29.405 --> 00:57:31.168
Martha Stewart faced charges...

860
00:57:33.909 --> 00:57:35.308
Oh, God!

861
00:58:15.951 --> 00:58:17.646
Okay, I think it's on. Go. Go.

862
00:58:17.953 --> 00:58:20.114
Aloha! I'm Henry Roth.

863
00:58:20.456 --> 00:58:26.452
We met here at the Hukilau Cafe
about a year after your accident.

864
00:58:26.462 --> 00:58:29.488
I like you and you like me, most days.

865
00:58:29.965 --> 00:58:33.230
Every day is different, but basically
this is what happens, Lucy.

866
00:58:33.469 --> 00:58:34.902
Kikikoloko, take the camera.

867
00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:36.232
- I got it.
- Don't drop it.

868
00:58:36.472 --> 00:58:38.497
Okay, all right.
Here we are, right here.

869
00:58:38.974 --> 00:58:41.306
The part of you in this reenactment...

870
00:58:41.341 --> 00:58:43.638
...will be played
by my good friend, Ula.

871
00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:47.040
Aloha. Sorry about your brain.

872
00:58:47.983 --> 00:58:49.382
I had a accident too.

873
00:58:49.485 --> 00:58:52.386
Believe it or not, this my good eye.

874
00:58:52.988 --> 00:58:54.216
- We ready?
- Yeah.

875
00:58:54.490 --> 00:58:58.187
Hi. I like that waffle teepee
that you have built.

876
00:58:58.494 --> 00:59:02.396
Oh! So nice of you to notice.
Please, sit down.

877
00:59:02.498 --> 00:59:04.466
I would love to.

878
00:59:05.501 --> 00:59:07.162
My name is Henry, by the way.

879
00:59:07.197 --> 00:59:08.902
My name is Lucy.

880
00:59:09.004 --> 00:59:11.029
Smell my fingers?

881
00:59:12.508 --> 00:59:14.066
Fish. Right on.

882
00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:17.502
So, Lucy, I work at an aquarium.

883
00:59:18.013 --> 00:59:20.481
Aquariums make me super horny.

884
00:59:20.516 --> 00:59:23.178
That's not funny.
Don't rub those.

885
00:59:23.519 --> 00:59:25.510
Sorry, Mr. Whitmore,
if you're watching.

886
00:59:25.521 --> 00:59:27.580
It's very late,
and my friend's unstable.

887
00:59:28.023 --> 00:59:30.719
Come on, stop with the licking!
You're making me sick.

888
00:59:30.754 --> 00:59:32.050
Lucy, I'm sorry.

889
00:59:32.528 --> 00:59:37.056
Anyways, I know you wish I was
making all this stuff up.

890
00:59:37.091 --> 00:59:39.193
I wish I was too.

891
00:59:40.536 --> 00:59:42.002
But the good news is...

892
00:59:42.037 --> 00:59:44.198
...so many people out there
care about you:

893
00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:48.203
Your dad and Doug and a couple
of your friends here at the Hukilau...

894
00:59:48.238 --> 00:59:49.704
...who have a message for you.

895
00:59:50.045 --> 00:59:53.981
Lucy, as you know,
your mother and I were best friends.

896
00:59:55.050 --> 00:59:59.111
That's why I promised her that
I would always help look after you.

897
01:00:01.056 --> 01:00:04.025
Sometimes life isn't very fair...

898
01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:06.584
...but we still have you.

899
01:00:09.064 --> 01:00:12.966
Oh, and if you're wondering about
this guy who's making this tape...

900
01:00:13.569 --> 01:00:16.197
...he's okay.

901
01:00:16.572 --> 01:00:20.235
Hey, Lucy. Just so you know,
since you lost your memory...

902
01:00:20.576 --> 01:00:23.272
...I became governor of Hawaii.

903
01:00:23.579 --> 01:00:25.945
No, just kidding. I'm too smart.

904
01:00:28.083 --> 01:00:32.019
Kualaliku! Get your brother
off the dishwasher!

905
01:00:33.088 --> 01:00:36.114
So whenever you're ready,
we'd all love to talk to you...

906
01:00:36.149 --> 01:00:38.025
...and answer any questions
you have...

907
01:00:38.093 --> 01:00:40.926
...and you're the best, Lucy. Aloha.

908
01:00:56.111 --> 01:00:58.636
How many times
have I watched this?

909
01:00:59.114 --> 01:01:00.581
This is the first time.

910
01:01:05.621 --> 01:01:08.454
Okay, she cried for about an hour.
That's not too bad.

911
01:01:08.624 --> 01:01:12.219
I bet in another hour she'll be ready
to see her friends, have lunch...

912
01:01:12.628 --> 01:01:13.856
...get her life back.

913
01:01:14.129 --> 01:01:16.063
We could do this every day.

914
01:01:18.634 --> 01:01:20.329
We'll leave it up to her.

915
01:01:20.636 --> 01:01:22.160
All right.

916
01:01:25.641 --> 01:01:27.836
So how's the cow?

917
01:01:28.143 --> 01:01:31.374
Same as you. Every day they
have to convince her she's a cow.

918
01:01:36.151 --> 01:01:38.847
Wow, look. The bark is healing.

919
01:01:38.882 --> 01:01:40.713
You're gonna get there.

920
01:01:41.156 --> 01:01:43.818
I never hung out with you
in the afternoon like this.

921
01:01:44.159 --> 01:01:46.627
In this lighting, man, oh, man,
you look...

922
01:01:46.662 --> 01:01:48.789
...disgusting.

923
01:01:49.164 --> 01:01:50.825
Yeah.

924
01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:56.001
I don't know how you get me to fall for
that egg-shaped head every morning.

925
01:01:56.171 --> 01:01:59.106
All I have to do is slide on
my designer jeans...

926
01:01:59.174 --> 01:02:02.701
...and just kind of wiggle
in front of you. You go nuts.

927
01:02:04.179 --> 01:02:07.842
Why couldn't I have met you one day
before the accident?

928
01:02:08.183 --> 01:02:11.812
Don't worry, because if you hung out
with me for more than one day...

929
01:02:12.187 --> 01:02:14.154
...you'd realize I'm a bore.

930
01:02:14.189 --> 01:02:16.384
- Oh, well, I have news for you.
- Yes?

931
01:02:16.692 --> 01:02:18.626
It takes less than one day.

932
01:02:18.694 --> 01:02:20.685
You know something?
That hurt.

933
01:02:20.696 --> 01:02:23.597
Your damaged temporal lobe
is causing me pain...

934
01:02:24.199 --> 01:02:26.030
...and I'm gonna get you for that.

935
01:02:27.202 --> 01:02:29.136
Now you're dead!

936
01:02:47.723 --> 01:02:50.886
- I can't believe you're pregnant.
- I know.

937
01:02:51.226 --> 01:02:54.252
- And I got her on the first try.
- Yeah. Easy.

938
01:02:54.287 --> 01:02:56.026
And, Tammy, you are so thin.

939
01:02:56.231 --> 01:02:57.562
Thanks, Luce.

940
01:02:57.733 --> 01:02:59.530
And I'm so glad you finally got...

941
01:02:59.735 --> 01:03:02.932
...that gender-reassignment surgery,
Jennifer. I mean, Jonathan.

942
01:03:03.238 --> 01:03:04.899
Mahalo.

943
01:03:05.741 --> 01:03:07.265
- Here you go, Lucy.
- Thank you.

944
01:03:07.743 --> 01:03:09.710
- You're welcome.
- You must be Lucy's friend.

945
01:03:09.745 --> 01:03:13.237
- The one who made the tape.
- I think he's more than my friend.

946
01:03:13.749 --> 01:03:15.716
- You're my boyfriend, right?
- Yes, ma'am.

947
01:03:15.751 --> 01:03:18.447
So every day you help her
to realize what happened...

948
01:03:18.754 --> 01:03:21.518
...and you wait patiently for her
to be okay with it...

949
01:03:21.757 --> 01:03:23.816
...then get her to fall in love
with you again?

950
01:03:24.259 --> 01:03:25.521
Yes, ma'am.

951
01:03:26.762 --> 01:03:27.990
You asshole!

952
01:03:28.263 --> 01:03:31.323
You don't even open the fricking car
door for me anymore.

953
01:03:32.267 --> 01:03:33.632
You're in trouble.

954
01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:36.397
I gotta go tinkle.

955
01:03:40.776 --> 01:03:44.268
Okay, so tell me a little bit more
about yourself.

956
01:03:44.279 --> 01:03:46.338
Okay. Well, I've...

957
01:03:46.782 --> 01:03:49.979
...won over seven all-you-can-eat
chicken-wing contests.

958
01:03:50.014 --> 01:03:51.912
- Really?
- Yes.

959
01:03:52.287 --> 01:03:55.313
And I'm a ballet dancer,
but only in my bathroom.

960
01:03:55.791 --> 01:03:58.225
No, what do you want to know?

961
01:03:59.795 --> 01:04:01.353
Do you love me?

962
01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.665
I didn't mean to put you on the spot.

963
01:04:06.802 --> 01:04:09.566
I was just asking more for
informational purposes.

964
01:04:09.805 --> 01:04:12.137
It's to keep the video as up-to-date
as possible.

965
01:04:12.307 --> 01:04:13.968
Sure.

966
01:04:14.810 --> 01:04:18.746
Well, love is a very loaded word.

967
01:04:21.316 --> 01:04:23.307
Let's see. I...

968
01:04:23.819 --> 01:04:29.121
I go to this restaurant every morning,
and I see you there, reading.

969
01:04:29.825 --> 01:04:31.690
And...

970
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:36.354
I love you very much.

971
01:04:36.832 --> 01:04:39.960
Probably more than anybody could
love another person.

972
01:04:43.839 --> 01:04:46.467
And how do I feel about you?

973
01:04:47.342 --> 01:04:49.810
You're excited about
the chicken-wing thing.

974
01:04:50.345 --> 01:04:52.142
And...

975
01:04:52.347 --> 01:04:55.544
...you've been dying to make out
with me for some time now.

976
01:05:07.362 --> 01:05:08.852
Feeling better now?

977
01:05:08.864 --> 01:05:11.697
Nothing beats a first kiss.

978
01:05:19.374 --> 01:05:22.502
There's nothing like a first kiss.

979
01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:47.027
Nothing beats a first kiss.

980
01:05:47.402 --> 01:05:49.563
That's what I've heard.

981
01:05:54.409 --> 01:05:56.536
Nothing beats a first...

982
01:06:07.923 --> 01:06:09.185
What are you doing?

983
01:06:09.424 --> 01:06:11.915
Nothing. I was just getting
some lint off for you.

984
01:06:11.927 --> 01:06:13.895
You were going for a feelski!

985
01:06:13.929 --> 01:06:18.832
All right, I'm sorry, but this is like the
23rd time we've made out already...

986
01:06:19.434 --> 01:06:20.924
...and they're getting blue.

987
01:06:21.436 --> 01:06:23.904
I know. I know.

988
01:06:23.939 --> 01:06:26.840
I mean, I really don't know.

989
01:06:26.942 --> 01:06:29.877
For me, it still feels like the first time.

990
01:06:29.945 --> 01:06:31.640
Okay, let's average it out then.

991
01:06:31.947 --> 01:06:34.882
It's the 23rd time for me
and the first time for you.

992
01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:37.282
- That's about our 12th time.
- Yeah?

993
01:06:37.452 --> 01:06:40.421
Now, Hawaiian law clearly states
after the 12th date...

994
01:06:40.956 --> 01:06:44.187
...I'm entitled to unlimited
boob access.

995
01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:49.260
Why didn't I meet you one day
before the accident?

996
01:06:50.465 --> 01:06:52.831
You say that all the time.

997
01:06:52.968 --> 01:06:54.936
You want to meet a friend of mine?

998
01:06:58.974 --> 01:07:00.532
All right.

999
01:07:01.476 --> 01:07:05.207
Jocko, this is Lucy.
Lucy, this is Jocko.

1000
01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:09.007
Wow! Thank you. Nice to meet you.

1001
01:07:09.985 --> 01:07:12.510
He is awesome! He is so smart.

1002
01:07:12.988 --> 01:07:17.220
Check this out. Jocko, what does
the teapot do when the water's ready?

1003
01:07:20.495 --> 01:07:22.395
- Very good.
- Can I ask him a question?

1004
01:07:22.497 --> 01:07:24.055
Go ahead.

1005
01:07:24.499 --> 01:07:26.160
Jocko...

1006
01:07:26.501 --> 01:07:30.198
...do you think that Henry and I
are ready to take our relationship...

1007
01:07:30.233 --> 01:07:31.802
...to the next level?

1008
01:07:33.508 --> 01:07:35.271
You sure about that?

1009
01:07:36.011 --> 01:07:38.741
Do you think I should bring him
into the other room...

1010
01:07:39.014 --> 01:07:41.448
...and take advantage of him?

1011
01:07:47.522 --> 01:07:49.319
I saw that hand gesture.

1012
01:07:49.524 --> 01:07:51.492
- And I'm glad you did it.
- Really?

1013
01:08:04.039 --> 01:08:06.007
- Use that.
- Oh, wow. Look!

1014
01:08:06.041 --> 01:08:07.269
- Yeah.
- They're...

1015
01:08:07.542 --> 01:08:09.976
They're nodding in approval, I hope.

1016
01:08:10.045 --> 01:08:12.411
They like you. Let me get them
out of there.

1017
01:08:12.547 --> 01:08:15.664
Mary-Kate, Ashley, get a life.
Thank you. Sorry.

1018
01:08:15.699 --> 01:08:18.781
- Oh, they're very nice, though.
- Yeah, so are you.

1019
01:08:19.054 --> 01:08:21.181
Let me get you down slow.

1020
01:08:21.556 --> 01:08:23.990
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

1021
01:08:46.581 --> 01:08:50.017
All right, I just wrote this,
so go easy on me.

1022
01:08:51.086 --> 01:08:54.715
The Hukilau was the place

1023
01:08:56.091 --> 01:08:58.525
Where I first saw your face

1024
01:09:00.595 --> 01:09:03.223
We liked each other right away

1025
01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:09.230
But you didn't remember me
The very next day

1026
01:09:10.105 --> 01:09:14.074
Forgetful Lucy

1027
01:09:14.109 --> 01:09:17.670
Has got a nice caboose-y

1028
01:09:19.114 --> 01:09:23.312
I used to trick you into pulling
Your car over so we could chat

1029
01:09:23.618 --> 01:09:27.987
But my favorite time was when you
Beat the shit out of Ula with a bat

1030
01:09:28.623 --> 01:09:32.059
And we drove up to see Dr. Keats

1031
01:09:32.627 --> 01:09:35.994
And found out why Doug always
Has to change his sheets

1032
01:09:38.133 --> 01:09:41.601
Forgetful Lucy

1033
01:09:41.636 --> 01:09:46.130
Cracked her head like Gary Busey

1034
01:09:46.641 --> 01:09:49.405
But I still love her so

1035
01:09:50.645 --> 01:09:53.910
And I'll never let her go

1036
01:09:55.150 --> 01:09:58.916
Even if while I'm singing this song

1037
01:09:59.654 --> 01:10:02.953
She's wishing I had
Jocko the Walrus' schlong

1038
01:10:04.659 --> 01:10:09.062
Forgetful Lucy

1039
01:10:09.664 --> 01:10:13.964
Her lips are so damn juicy

1040
01:10:13.999 --> 01:10:18.264
How about another first kiss

1041
01:10:28.683 --> 01:10:30.810
Can't fall asleep.

1042
01:10:31.186 --> 01:10:33.154
I'm not sleeping.

1043
01:10:33.188 --> 01:10:35.986
I'm just closing my eyes.

1044
01:10:36.191 --> 01:10:38.421
Well, I'm gonna go downstairs then.

1045
01:10:38.693 --> 01:10:42.891
No, no. I'm just resting.

1046
01:10:44.699 --> 01:10:46.291
Lucy.

1047
01:10:46.701 --> 01:10:48.168
Yeah.

1048
01:10:48.203 --> 01:10:50.194
Will you marry me?

1049
01:10:57.712 --> 01:11:01.079
- Of course.
- Good.

1050
01:11:01.716 --> 01:11:04.310
Don't forget about me.

1051
01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:07.085
Never.

1052
01:11:24.239 --> 01:11:25.672
Good morning.

1053
01:11:32.247 --> 01:11:33.475
Oh, shit!

1054
01:11:33.748 --> 01:11:35.909
- Help! Help!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Lucy.

1055
01:11:35.944 --> 01:11:38.583
Lucy! Lucy! Hey, hey, hey.

1056
01:11:38.753 --> 01:11:40.983
I know this is hard for you
to understand...

1057
01:11:41.256 --> 01:11:43.588
...but we are actually
seeing each other.

1058
01:11:43.758 --> 01:11:45.589
We have been for a while now.

1059
01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:46.988
Oh! Lucy! Lucy! Lucy!

1060
01:11:47.262 --> 01:11:49.423
If I was lying,
how would I know this?

1061
01:11:49.764 --> 01:11:52.927
You're an art teacher and you go
to the Hukilau every Sunday...

1062
01:11:53.268 --> 01:11:56.829
...and you make waffle houses
and you like Casablanca lilies.

1063
01:11:56.864 --> 01:12:00.138
- Stalker!
- No, don't you remember me a little?

1064
01:12:07.282 --> 01:12:10.012
I may not be able to kick your ass,
but my sister can.

1065
01:12:10.285 --> 01:12:11.547
Thanks, buddy.

1066
01:12:11.786 --> 01:12:14.550
Little Sammy Sosa's a bit shook up,
but she'll be okay.

1067
01:12:14.789 --> 01:12:16.620
She's watching the tape as we speak.

1068
01:12:16.791 --> 01:12:18.758
How's my temporal lobe
looking there, doc?

1069
01:12:18.793 --> 01:12:22.194
Don't worry. You're not gonna suffer
any short-term memory loss.

1070
01:12:22.797 --> 01:12:25.732
But was your head shaped like an egg
before she hit you?

1071
01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:29.133
Don't make fun of Henry.
It's not his fault it's shaped like that.

1072
01:12:29.304 --> 01:12:32.671
Note the intense overreaction.
That's the "roids" talking.

1073
01:12:32.807 --> 01:12:36.504
- Doug, once again, off the juice.
- It's not juice.

1074
01:12:36.811 --> 01:12:38.642
It's a protein shake.

1075
01:12:38.813 --> 01:12:42.647
Henry, the boys tell me you're setting
sail for Alaska to study walruses.

1076
01:12:42.817 --> 01:12:45.615
- When does that adventure begin?
- That actually began...

1077
01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:49.847
...ten years ago. That's when I started
planning and building my boat.

1078
01:12:50.325 --> 01:12:54.455
All I know is, out of all mammals,
they have the second-largest penis.

1079
01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:57.388
I have the first.

1080
01:12:59.334 --> 01:13:00.665
That's my joke.

1081
01:13:00.835 --> 01:13:02.632
Did you tell Lucy about this trip?

1082
01:13:03.338 --> 01:13:04.805
Well...

1083
01:13:04.839 --> 01:13:08.707
...actually, there's nothing to tell
because I decided not to go.

1084
01:13:08.843 --> 01:13:10.640
I mean, Lucy needs me here.

1085
01:13:10.845 --> 01:13:14.042
I'm just worried about
going away for a year...

1086
01:13:14.349 --> 01:13:16.647
...and ruining all the progress
she's made.

1087
01:13:16.851 --> 01:13:18.341
I know you think I'm crazy...

1088
01:13:18.353 --> 01:13:20.116
...but I think deep down inside...

1089
01:13:20.355 --> 01:13:23.847
- ... she's starting to remember me.
- No, Henry.

1090
01:13:23.858 --> 01:13:27.419
That's what you want to believe.
It's what we all want to believe.

1091
01:13:28.363 --> 01:13:29.830
But it's never gonna happen.

1092
01:13:33.868 --> 01:13:35.995
Okay. I gotta go to work.

1093
01:13:36.871 --> 01:13:39.755
Will you tell her I'll be back later
to pick her up?

1094
01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:42.639
See you, guys. Don't tell anyone
your sister beat me up.

1095
01:13:43.378 --> 01:13:47.109
He could go to the moon and back and
Lucy would never even know he left.

1096
01:13:47.382 --> 01:13:50.545
Sometimes I wish my wife
had Goldfield Syndrome.

1097
01:13:50.885 --> 01:13:53.854
That way she wouldn't remember
when I called her mother...

1098
01:13:54.389 --> 01:13:58.689
...a loud, obnoxious drunk with a face
like J. Edgar Hoover's ass.

1099
01:14:00.895 --> 01:14:04.023
All right. There's your medicine,
little fellow.

1100
01:14:04.399 --> 01:14:07.095
Ula! Get back to cleaning the pool!

1101
01:14:07.402 --> 01:14:11.532
If that's one of your special brownies,
don't let any of the dolphins eat that.

1102
01:14:11.906 --> 01:14:15.342
How do you think I get them to
double flip and play with white kids?

1103
01:14:18.913 --> 01:14:20.244
Okay, Willie, that's it.

1104
01:14:20.415 --> 01:14:23.009
This time try to stay clean
for more than a day.

1105
01:14:23.418 --> 01:14:25.613
I made you a nice anchovy sundae.

1106
01:14:25.648 --> 01:14:27.285
Okay, enjoy that.

1107
01:14:27.922 --> 01:14:29.389
Henry?

1108
01:14:29.924 --> 01:14:32.154
- Hey!
- How's your head?

1109
01:14:32.427 --> 01:14:35.590
- Oh, it's fine. Don't worry.
- Good.

1110
01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:37.955
What brings your royal cuteness
out here?

1111
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:39.331
I needed to see you.

1112
01:14:39.934 --> 01:14:41.424
Okay. What you got there?

1113
01:14:41.936 --> 01:14:44.598
It's my journal. I write in it every night.

1114
01:14:44.939 --> 01:14:47.703
- Oh, you don't like the video?
- No, I love it.

1115
01:14:47.942 --> 01:14:52.311
It's just sometimes when I watch it,
I feel like I'm being told about my life...

1116
01:14:52.447 --> 01:14:54.915
...from someone else.
And when I read this...

1117
01:14:54.949 --> 01:14:57.679
...it's like I'm telling myself.

1118
01:14:57.952 --> 01:14:59.476
When did you start this up?

1119
01:14:59.954 --> 01:15:01.888
Right after you gave me the video.

1120
01:15:01.956 --> 01:15:04.288
- Really?
- I was so nervous to come here...

1121
01:15:04.459 --> 01:15:07.792
...and meet the guy that makes me
fall in love with him every day.

1122
01:15:08.463 --> 01:15:11.523
Well, you probably thought
I couldn't live up to the hype.

1123
01:15:11.558 --> 01:15:15.163
No. I was nervous because...

1124
01:15:17.472 --> 01:15:19.736
Because I came here
to break up with you.

1125
01:15:20.975 --> 01:15:24.944
You had plans and a life...

1126
01:15:24.979 --> 01:15:27.709
...before you met me
and now all you have time for...

1127
01:15:27.982 --> 01:15:30.280
...is to make me fall in love with you.

1128
01:15:30.485 --> 01:15:33.420
That's not all I do.
I gave a penguin a bath today.

1129
01:15:36.491 --> 01:15:38.425
Which I'll have to do again tomorrow.

1130
01:15:38.493 --> 01:15:43.123
I look at my dad and my brother's
lives and I won't do that to you.

1131
01:15:43.498 --> 01:15:47.867
What do you want me to do? Be some
chapter in your scrapbook and go?

1132
01:15:48.002 --> 01:15:49.469
No.

1133
01:15:50.505 --> 01:15:56.933
My plan is to erase you completely,
so it's as if you never existed.

1134
01:15:59.013 --> 01:16:01.140
Why are you doing this?

1135
01:16:02.016 --> 01:16:06.282
Because you have to understand
that there is no future with me.

1136
01:16:06.521 --> 01:16:11.618
Don't you want to have a career
and marriage and children?

1137
01:16:12.026 --> 01:16:14.221
I asked you to marry me. You said yes.

1138
01:16:14.256 --> 01:16:15.859
Kids? Yeah, I'd love to do it.

1139
01:16:17.031 --> 01:16:19.898
But how is that going to work?

1140
01:16:20.034 --> 01:16:24.300
I'm gonna wake up every morning with
an enormous belly and no memory...

1141
01:16:24.539 --> 01:16:25.836
...of how it happened?

1142
01:16:27.542 --> 01:16:30.943
I have to make a new journal
that doesn't have you in it.

1143
01:16:31.045 --> 01:16:32.842
But before I do...

1144
01:16:33.047 --> 01:16:35.777
...I really want you to read
what I wrote about you.

1145
01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:37.915
I will read about it tomorrow...

1146
01:16:38.052 --> 01:16:41.146
...when you forget about all this
breaking up stuff, okay?

1147
01:16:41.556 --> 01:16:44.957
I'm not going to forget it.
I wrote it down. I won't let myself.

1148
01:16:45.059 --> 01:16:48.028
And I'm gonna do it whether
you want me to or not.

1149
01:16:48.563 --> 01:16:50.861
I'll be at my house.

1150
01:16:59.073 --> 01:17:01.268
Okay, type this one in there.

1151
01:17:01.576 --> 01:17:03.339
Saturday, November 25th.

1152
01:17:03.578 --> 01:17:08.379
I drove out to Callahan Institute today
and had a talk with Dr. Keats.

1153
01:17:09.083 --> 01:17:10.880
There's one about me.

1154
01:17:11.085 --> 01:17:15.283
Reminder: He makes funny noises
when I kiss his neck.

1155
01:17:16.591 --> 01:17:18.057
I'm gonna miss that.

1156
01:17:18.092 --> 01:17:20.287
You sure you don't want me
to put that in?

1157
01:17:29.103 --> 01:17:31.070
- We can skip that one.
- No, let me read it.

1158
01:17:31.105 --> 01:17:35.371
We made love tonight! It didn't
last long, but it was incredible.

1159
01:17:38.112 --> 01:17:42.515
It's not all about how long you go. It's...
There was a connection, I thought.

1160
01:17:44.118 --> 01:17:45.847
Actually, let's just rip that out.

1161
01:18:08.643 --> 01:18:11.009
Well, that's that.

1162
01:18:18.653 --> 01:18:20.678
Henry, wait!

1163
01:18:26.661 --> 01:18:29.653
Could I have one last first kiss?

1164
01:19:41.736 --> 01:19:45.263
- I ain't gonna do this, Marlin.
- You have to, Henry.

1165
01:20:18.773 --> 01:20:21.867
I'm gonna miss you, but I gotta
get the hell off this island.

1166
01:20:21.902 --> 01:20:23.300
I'm sorry I can't take you...

1167
01:20:23.778 --> 01:20:27.805
...but you've lived here so long you're
too big of a pansy to defend yourself.

1168
01:20:29.283 --> 01:20:32.980
I don't feel bad for you. I know you
got a thing going on with Candace.

1169
01:20:36.791 --> 01:20:38.258
Candace and Bernice?

1170
01:20:40.795 --> 01:20:42.660
Candace, Bernice and Rose?

1171
01:20:44.799 --> 01:20:48.428
Yeah. I fell for one chick and I'm losing
my mind. Good luck with that.

1172
01:20:48.803 --> 01:20:50.202
Okay, baby.

1173
01:20:50.304 --> 01:20:51.965
I love you.

1174
01:20:52.306 --> 01:20:54.774
Thanks, buddy.
Remember to use a condom.

1175
01:20:55.309 --> 01:20:57.300
Or in your case, a Hefty bag.

1176
01:21:07.822 --> 01:21:09.255
Well...

1177
01:21:09.323 --> 01:21:12.417
Okay, you guys. Thanks for coming
to say goodbye.

1178
01:21:12.827 --> 01:21:14.522
Be careful.

1179
01:21:14.829 --> 01:21:17.764
You make sure your father doesn't
get eaten by a shark.

1180
01:21:24.338 --> 01:21:27.273
Thank you, buddy.
What does that mean again?

1181
01:21:27.842 --> 01:21:29.639
Bring me back a T-shirt.

1182
01:21:29.844 --> 01:21:32.176
Oh, okay. You got it.

1183
01:21:32.847 --> 01:21:35.042
Come here. All right. Love you guys.

1184
01:21:35.850 --> 01:21:38.785
My shirt size is medium husky.

1185
01:21:40.855 --> 01:21:43.153
Hey! Kikikuloa!

1186
01:21:43.357 --> 01:21:46.155
No flippies off the dock!
You could get hurt!

1187
01:21:48.863 --> 01:21:53.732
No! All right. Let the master
show you how to get it done.

1188
01:22:01.876 --> 01:22:05.505
Now you kids go down there
and find my nuts.

1189
01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:07.711
Sure you don't want to take Doug?

1190
01:22:07.882 --> 01:22:11.511
Hey! What the heck
are you guys doing here?

1191
01:22:11.886 --> 01:22:16.448
I spoke to the harbormaster and he
said you were setting sail today...

1192
01:22:16.483 --> 01:22:18.620
...so we thought we'd wish
you bon voyage.

1193
01:22:18.893 --> 01:22:21.885
This is from Nick and Sue.
They send their best wishes.

1194
01:22:22.396 --> 01:22:26.230
That's very nice.
Spam and Reese's. All right.

1195
01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:28.800
I love Spam and Reese's.
Can I have it?

1196
01:22:28.903 --> 01:22:30.495
I guess.

1197
01:22:31.405 --> 01:22:33.498
- Doug!
- That's all right.

1198
01:22:33.533 --> 01:22:36.433
- I'm sorry.
- So...

1199
01:22:37.411 --> 01:22:38.673
...how's Lucy?

1200
01:22:39.413 --> 01:22:42.143
Actually, she's living at the institute.

1201
01:22:42.917 --> 01:22:46.284
- When did that happen?
- Three weeks ago.

1202
01:22:46.921 --> 01:22:50.652
Said she didn't want to be a burden to
me and Doug anymore. I don't know.

1203
01:22:50.925 --> 01:22:53.393
I couldn't talk her out of it.
You know what?

1204
01:22:53.427 --> 01:22:55.622
She's doing really great up there.

1205
01:22:55.930 --> 01:22:58.990
She's teaching an art class
and she gets to paint every day.

1206
01:22:59.433 --> 01:23:01.264
In fact, she's even singing again.

1207
01:23:01.435 --> 01:23:03.630
Hey, look, I got a little gift
for you too.

1208
01:23:03.938 --> 01:23:07.738
It's just a little something
from one sailor to another one.

1209
01:23:09.443 --> 01:23:11.377
You take care of yourself out there.

1210
01:23:11.946 --> 01:23:14.380
- I will.
- Okay.

1211
01:23:22.957 --> 01:23:24.891
Henry did not tell me about you.

1212
01:23:24.959 --> 01:23:27.553
Your fisherman muscles.

1213
01:23:28.462 --> 01:23:29.724
Can I touch?

1214
01:23:29.964 --> 01:23:31.795
Sure.

1215
01:23:37.471 --> 01:23:39.405
Yes.

1216
01:23:46.981 --> 01:23:48.278
The Beach Boys?

1217
01:23:48.482 --> 01:23:51.349
How nice of him to give me a CD
that will remind me...

1218
01:23:51.986 --> 01:23:55.444
...of all the wonderful times
I shared with his daughter.

1219
01:23:55.489 --> 01:23:57.889
What an asshole!

1220
01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:18.535
Oh, why?

1221
01:24:19.013 --> 01:24:21.345
Why would you do this to me?

1222
01:24:21.515 --> 01:24:24.040
You sick bastard!

1223
01:24:28.522 --> 01:24:30.080
Oh, my God.

1224
01:24:31.025 --> 01:24:32.959
Is he trying to tell me something?

1225
01:24:37.531 --> 01:24:39.965
She only sings on days
she meets you.

1226
01:24:42.036 --> 01:24:44.004
She remembers me?

1227
01:24:44.538 --> 01:24:46.130
Holy shit!

1228
01:24:47.541 --> 01:24:50.305
She remembers me!

1229
01:24:55.549 --> 01:24:57.466
Julia, that looks great.

1230
01:24:57.501 --> 01:24:59.383
Excuse me. What am I doing?

1231
01:25:00.054 --> 01:25:03.319
You're painting a picture.
And you're doing an excellent job.

1232
01:25:03.557 --> 01:25:05.184
Oh.

1233
01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:09.586
Holy crap! I suck.

1234
01:25:18.072 --> 01:25:19.767
Hey, hey, hey.

1235
01:25:20.074 --> 01:25:22.907
- Can we help you, sir?
- Yes. I have an appointment.

1236
01:25:23.077 --> 01:25:25.511
- What's your name?
- My name?

1237
01:25:28.082 --> 01:25:31.279
Dude, he forgot his name.
I feel bad for him.

1238
01:25:31.585 --> 01:25:34.486
Just go on up. And good luck
with that memory problem.

1239
01:25:34.588 --> 01:25:36.579
Yeah. Thank you.

1240
01:25:38.592 --> 01:25:39.889
What?

1241
01:25:40.594 --> 01:25:42.687
Lucy!

1242
01:25:43.097 --> 01:25:44.792
Lucy!

1243
01:25:45.099 --> 01:25:47.749
- Hi, I'm Tom.
- Hey, I met you before. I'm Henry.

1244
01:25:47.784 --> 01:25:50.399
Maybe you can help me.
I'm looking for Lucy Whitmore.

1245
01:25:50.604 --> 01:25:52.128
Any idea where I can find her?

1246
01:25:52.606 --> 01:25:53.572
Hi, I'm Tom.

1247
01:25:53.607 --> 01:25:56.576
Oh. Thanks anyways.

1248
01:25:57.611 --> 01:25:59.476
Lucy!

1249
01:26:00.114 --> 01:26:01.581
Lucy!

1250
01:26:05.619 --> 01:26:07.382
Lucy Whitmore...

1251
01:26:08.622 --> 01:26:10.487
...can I ask you a question?

1252
01:26:13.627 --> 01:26:15.822
Do you have any idea who I am?

1253
01:26:22.136 --> 01:26:25.299
- No.
- No?

1254
01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:28.665
That sucks.

1255
01:26:30.144 --> 01:26:33.136
- What's your name?
- I'm Henry.

1256
01:26:33.647 --> 01:26:35.410
Henry.

1257
01:26:36.650 --> 01:26:39.517
I want to show you something.
Will you come with me?

1258
01:26:40.154 --> 01:26:41.553
Well, yeah.

1259
01:26:43.157 --> 01:26:45.091
Hey. Do you know who that guy is?

1260
01:26:45.159 --> 01:26:47.320
Dude, I don't even know who I am.

1261
01:26:47.661 --> 01:26:49.925
Oh, well, you're Pablo Picasso.

1262
01:26:50.164 --> 01:26:53.861
- Really?
- No. Not really.

1263
01:26:57.171 --> 01:26:59.833
This is my studio.

1264
01:27:19.193 --> 01:27:21.855
I don't know who you are, Henry...

1265
01:27:23.697 --> 01:27:27.633
...but I dream about you
almost every night.

1266
01:27:30.204 --> 01:27:31.728
Why?

1267
01:27:32.206 --> 01:27:36.267
What would you say if I told you
that notebook you read every day...

1268
01:27:36.710 --> 01:27:39.736
...used to have a lot of stuff
about me in it?

1269
01:27:41.215 --> 01:27:43.809
I would say that that
makes a lot of sense.

1270
01:27:44.218 --> 01:27:46.015
You erased me
from your memories...

1271
01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:49.383
...because you thought you were
holding me back from having...

1272
01:27:49.723 --> 01:27:51.452
...a full and happy life.

1273
01:27:51.725 --> 01:27:54.216
But you made a mistake.

1274
01:27:54.728 --> 01:27:58.357
Being with you is the only way
I could have a full and happy life.

1275
01:27:59.233 --> 01:28:01.497
You're the girl of my dreams...

1276
01:28:01.735 --> 01:28:05.501
...and apparently I'm the man of yours.

1277
01:28:10.244 --> 01:28:12.007
Henry.

1278
01:28:12.246 --> 01:28:13.645
It's nice to meet you.

1279
01:28:14.248 --> 01:28:17.240
Lucy, it's nice to meet you too.

1280
01:28:21.755 --> 01:28:23.723
Hi, I'm Tom.

1281
01:28:23.757 --> 01:28:25.918
Henry, Lucy. Nice to meet you, Tom.

1282
01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:29.889
Now why don't you come back in
ten seconds so we can meet again?

1283
01:29:15.309 --> 01:29:18.904
Do you, Honah Lee, take this woman
to be your lawfully wedded wife...

1284
01:29:18.939 --> 01:29:21.178
...to have and to hold
from this day forth...

1285
01:29:21.815 --> 01:29:23.908
...as long as you both shall live?

1286
01:29:23.943 --> 01:29:25.785
- I do.
- Really?

1287
01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:28.515
Even though in, like, 10, 15 years...

1288
01:29:28.822 --> 01:29:31.518
...she could possibly let herself
go and then, like...

1289
01:29:31.553 --> 01:29:33.691
...sex could be, like,
nauseating for you?

1290
01:29:33.827 --> 01:29:36.523
What are you, nuts?
Your wife's right over there.

1291
01:29:38.832 --> 01:29:40.561
I'm just kidding, Muumuu!

1292
01:29:40.834 --> 01:29:43.701
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1293
01:29:48.842 --> 01:29:51.310
Mazel tov!

1294
01:29:52.346 --> 01:29:54.439
It's very cold, so when you're ready...

1295
01:29:54.848 --> 01:29:58.477
...put on a jacket and come have
breakfast with me. Love you.

1296
01:30:30.384 --> 01:30:35.481
Hey, hey! Good morning, Mrs. Roth.
Would you like to meet your daughter?

1297
01:30:35.889 --> 01:30:37.151
Go say hello to Mommy.

1298
01:30:38.892 --> 01:30:40.553
Hi, Mommy.

1299
01:30:42.896 --> 01:30:44.887
That's right.

1300
01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:48.027
Good morning.

1301
01:30:49.903 --> 01:30:52.064
Oh, my goodness!

1302
01:30:52.906 --> 01:30:55.238
- Grandpa's here.
- Hi, Dad.
